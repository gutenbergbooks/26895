<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE DAWN OF A WEDDING-JOURNEY</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hector Archibald were prosperous
and happy dwellers in a suburb of one of
our large towns. Fortune had favored them in
many ways&mdash;in health and in a good average
happiness. They had reached early middle age,
and their daughter Kate, their only child, had
grown up to be a beautiful and good young
woman, and was on the point of marrying a
young lawyer&mdash;Rodney Bringhurst by name&mdash;in
every way worthy of her.</p>
<p>Hector Archibald was a little man, with small
bright eyes, and hair slightly touched with gray
and very much inclined to curl. His disposition
was lively. He had a strong liking for cheerful
occurrences, and was always willing to do his
part in the bringing about of such events. Novelty
had a charm for him. He was not bound by
precedence and tradition, and if he had found
himself at a dinner which began with coffee and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
ended with oysters on the half-shell, he would
have given the unusual meal a most animated
consideration, although he might have utterly
withheld any subsequent approbation. As a general
thing, he revolved in an orbit where one
might always be able to find him, were the proper
calculations made. But if any one drew a tangent
for him, and its direction seemed suitable
and interesting, he was perfectly willing to fly
off on it.</p>
<p>The disposition of Mrs. Hector Archibald was
different. She was born to be guided by customs,
fashions, and forms. She believed it was the
duty of a married woman to make her home
happy, and she did it. But she also believed that
in the best domestic circles there were rules and
usages for domestic happiness which would apply
to every domestic condition and contingency.
It frequently troubled her, however, to find that
certain customs, forms, or usages of domestic society
had changed, and being of a conservative
turn of mind, it was difficult for her to adapt herself
to these changes. But, thoroughly loyal to
the idea that what was done by people she loved
and people she respected ought also to be done
by her, she earnestly strove to fit herself to new
conditions, especially when she saw that by not
doing so she would be out of touch with her family
and her friends.</p>
<p>Now of course the wedding of their daughter
was the only thing in the world that seemed of
real importance to Mr. and Mrs. Archibald, and
for this all preparations and plans had been
agreed upon and made with great good-will and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
harmony, excepting one thing, and that was the
wedding-trip. Strange to say, the young people
did not wish to take a wedding-trip. They believed
that this old-fashioned custom was unnecessary,
troublesome, commonplace, and stupid.
In the gardens and grounds of the Archibald
mansion, and in the beautiful surrounding country,
they had loved each other as lovers, and
among these scenes they wished to begin to love
each other as a married couple. Why should
such distasteful and unpleasant ingredients as
railroad-cars, steamboats, and hotels be dashed
into the pleasing mixture of their new lives? It
had been arranged that for a year or two, at
least, they should live in Kate&#8217;s dear old home,
and why should they not immediately begin that
life there?</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald did not favor this plan, and his
wife was strongly opposed to it. A wedding
without a wedding-trip ought not to be thought
of.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the honey-moon a young couple
should live for each other, with each other, apart
from the rest of the world. It is a beautiful custom,
which should not be rudely trampled upon,&#8221;
said Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>But although Mrs. Archibald cherished a belief
that she ought to conform her ideas to the domestic
customs of the day, her daughter Kate
cherished the belief that the domestic customs of
the day ought to conform themselves to her
ideas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we should like to be alone in the
honey-moon,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;We don&#8217;t object
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
to that; and if there must be a wedding-journey,
you and father can take it and we will stay here.
Here are servants, books, things to eat, and everything
our hearts can desire, and here we
would really feel as if we were beginning life as
man and wife. As for you two, you both need a
vacation, and nothing could be more perfectly
appropriate and more delightful to everybody
than that you should take our wedding-trip. We
don&#8217;t want it; we will make it a present to you.
Take it and be happy, and leave us here to be
happy. People have done this sort of thing before,
so that it is not absolutely wild and unheard
of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald welcomed this plan with open
arms, and hugged it and his daughter to his
breast. It suited him admirably, and he declared
that all business and engagements of every kind
should be set aside, and that he would be ready
to start on the wedding-journey with Mrs. Archibald
the moment the ceremony should be completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will wait until the reception is over, father?&#8221;
said Kate, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will wait for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>This novel proposition sent a chill through
every fibre of Mrs. Archibald&#8217;s physical organism.
At first she did not exactly comprehend it,
but when she did, the chills increased. When
she had recovered herself a little she began to
make objections. This was easy enough, for they
crowded into her mind like sheep into a pen; but
every objection, as she brought it forth, was
ruthlessly set aside or crushed to earth by her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
daughter or her husband, assisted by her expectant
son-in-law, of whom she declared she never
would have believed such a thing had she been
told it.</p>
<p>The discussion ended, of course, by Mrs. Archibald
agreeing to go on this absurd wedding-journey.
But the good lady&#8217;s mental troubles
were not over when she had given her consent.
As this scheme had been devised by those dearest
to her on earth, and as it was certain, these dearest
persons assured her, to meet with the approbation
of all people of advanced thought&mdash;at least
of those whose thought had advanced far enough
to make it worthy of their consideration&mdash;she
felt that in doing her part she ought to do it
honestly and with her whole heart; and at her
time of life, to act as a proxy for a young bride
by taking a wedding-journey in that young bride&#8217;s
place was a very difficult thing for Mrs. Archibald
to do honestly and with her whole heart.
But she would try to do it. Whatever else happened,
her family must be kept happy, and it
should never be said of her that she hung like a
millstone around the combined neck of that
family when it was unitedly climbing towards
altitudes of felicity, which, although she
was not able to discern them, must exist, since
that fact had been so earnestly insisted upon
by Mr. Archibald, Kate, and Rodney Bringhurst.</p>
<p>Thus was this exceptional hymeneal performance
decided upon, and at eleven o&#8217;clock on
Wednesday, the 6th of June, the marriage service
was performed. At noon the guests sat down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
to breakfast, and at two o&#8217;clock that afternoon
Mr. and Mrs. Hector Archibald departed on the
wedding-trip, leaving behind Mr. and Mrs. Bringhurst
at home with each other, and &#8220;not at home&#8221;
to the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>ENTER MARGERY</h3>
</div>

<p>At four o&#8217;clock on the afternoon of June 6th Mr.
and Mrs. Hector Archibald arrived at a family
hotel in the capital of their state. Where they
should go from there had not been decided upon.
Nothing in regard to their wedding-journey had
been decided upon except that they were to return
to their home on the 6th of July of that
year, and not before. It would have been impossible,
with their minds filled with bridal arrangements,
for them to make plans for their journey.
But at this first stopping-place, where they were
free from all responsibility and interruptions,
they could, at their leisure, decide where they
should go, how they should go, and what they
should do when they got there.</p>
<p>After the unrest and turmoil of their own home
during the past few weeks, the quiet and repose
of this city hotel were delightful. That evening
they went to the theatre, and after the performance
they had a little supper at a restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;People may not think we are a newly married
pair,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, as he poured out a
glass of wine for his wife, &#8220;but it is not impossible
that they may see we know how to enjoy ourselves
quite as much as if we were.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>The next morning Mr. Archibald procured a
number of railroad maps, time-tables, circulars of
steamboat excursions, advertisements of mountain
retreats and sea-side resorts, and he and his
wife sat down to study these, and to decide upon
a destination and a route. After an hour or two
of indeterminate examination Mr. Archibald declared
himself a little tired, and proposed that
they should take a recess from their labors and
go and call upon their old friends, the Stanley
Dearborns.</p>
<p>&#8220;People on wedding-tours do not make calls,&#8221;
said Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be true,&#8221; said her husband, &#8220;in
ordinary cases, and although I do not care to
announce to everybody the peculiarities of the
expedition which we have undertaken, I do not
mind in the least telling the Stanley Dearborns
all about it. Stanley himself would not appreciate
it; he would consider it absurd; but then
he is not at home at this time of day, and Mrs.
Dearborn is just the woman to enjoy a reform
movement of this sort. Besides, she is full of
ideas about everything, and she may propose
some good place for us to go to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dearborn was at home, and very glad to
see the Archibalds. She was a woman whose
soul was in touch with the higher education of
women&mdash;with female suffrage, the emancipation
of the enslaved mind wherever it might be found,
and with progress generally. She was a member
of many societies, belonged to committees without
end, wrote reports and minutes by day and by
night, and was one of that ever-increasing class
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
of good people who continually walk forward in
order that their weight may help the world to
turn over.</p>
<p>In spite of her principles and the advanced
position of her thought, Mrs. Dearborn actually
leaned back in her chair and laughed heartily
when she learned what sort of a journey the
Archibalds were taking. In this merriment Mr.
Archibald joined with great glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since I left home,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have
wanted to have a chance for a good laugh at this
trip we are taking. It is the most delightful
joke I have ever known.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald could not help smiling, but her
brow was clouded. &#8220;If this expedition is merely
a joke,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I do not think we should have
undertaken it; but if it is an earnest assertion of
our belief that there should be a change in the
customs of society, then I think we should take
it seriously, and I see nothing to laugh at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Harriet,&#8221; said Mrs. Dearborn, &#8220;we
can be good and glad at the same time; and that
is what I am, I am sure. What you are doing is
the initiation of one of the most worthy reforms
of the day, and if it should have an effect in
breaking up that wretched custom of the bridal
tramp, which is considered so necessary in this
country, society should rise up and call you
blessed. But it is funny, for all that. I am sure
that the first woman who dared to go without
crinoline was very funny, and when I heard of a
hospital for cats I could not help laughing; but I
believed in it, and worked for it. And now where
are you going?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is what we want to talk to you about,&#8221;
said Mr. Archibald; and for half an hour they
talked about it.</p>
<p>At the end of that time it was decided that the
mountains were better than the sea or than a
quiet lowland nook; and Mrs. Dearborn strongly
recommended Sadler&#8217;s, where she and her husband
had spent a part of a summer a few years
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;We camped out,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and had a fine
time. You can camp out at Sadler&#8217;s more easily
and satisfactorily than anywhere else in the
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Camping suited Mr. Archibald admirably, and,
to his surprise, his wife said she might like it very
well.</p>
<p>&#8220;If people are going to laugh at us,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;when they find out we are on a wedding-journey&mdash;and
they will be sure to find it out in some way
or other&mdash;I think the fewer people we mingle with
the better. I do not think I shall like camping
altogether, but I know it is healthful, and I suppose
I ought to get used to it. It would be dreadfully
lonely for just Mr. Archibald and me, but I
suppose we can take some one with us to guide
and cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Harriet,&#8221; said Mrs. Dearborn, &#8220;if you
are at Sadler&#8217;s, you can go into any sort of camp
you please. I will tell you all about Sadler&#8217;s.
Sadler is a man of progress. His hotel or inn is
on the very edge of the forest country, and away
from all the centres of resort. He calls his place
the terminal link of public travel in that direction.
When you leave him you travel privately in any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
way you like. He has established what he has
named a bureau of camping, and he furnishes his
patrons with any sort of a camp they may desire.
If the party is few in number and of a timid disposition,
they can have a camp within shouting
distance of his house. If they are brave and adventurous,
he will send them out into the depths
of the forest. If they like water, he locates them
by the shores of a lake. If climbing is their
passion, he puts them at the foot of a mountain.
Those who want to hunt can do so, and those who
dislike fire-arms are placed in a camp where the
popping of guns is never heard. He provides
tents, guides, provisions, and even dangers and
sensations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Safety is what I want,&#8221; interrupted Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that he furnishes,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;for
those who desire it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadler is the man for me!&#8221; cried Mr. Archibald.
&#8220;We will go to him, look over his list of
camps, and select one to suit us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By-the-way,&#8221; said Mrs. Dearborn, &#8220;a thought
has struck me. How would you like to take Margery
with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Archibald. &#8220;That
delightful little girl whom I taught to ride a tricycle
when you were visiting us? I would like it
ever so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>It struck Mrs. Archibald that people on bridal
trips did not generally take children or young
girls with them, but it also struck her that if they
were going into camp it might be pleasant and in
many ways advantageous to have some one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
her own sex with her; but she had no time to
formulate these advantages in her mind before
Mrs. Dearborn explained in full.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Mr. Dearborn and I came home from Sadler&#8217;s,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;Margery has been perfectly wild
to go there, and as soon as the leaves began to
bud in the parks she began to talk about it.
We saw no possible chance of her going there, for
her father is too busy to leave home for any
length of time this season, and I cannot go to
the mountains this year, for I must visit my
sister, who is not well, and there are three summer
conventions that I am obliged to attend.
But if you could take her with you, I do not believe
she would trouble you in the least, and you
would give her great pleasure. Moreover, to
speak practically, which I think we always ought
to do, it would not be a bad thing on the score of
economy, for things are always proportionately
cheaper for three people in a camp than for two.&#8221;</p>
<p>A great many advantages of female companionship
now began to creep into Mrs. Archibald&#8217;s
mind: if her husband should take it into his head
to go out and hunt at night by the light of a
torch; if there should be thunder-storms, and he
away with the guide; if he should want to go off
and talk to Indians or trappers, and he always did
want to go off and talk to people of every class&mdash;it
would be very pleasant to have even Margery
Dearborn with her. So she consented with great
good-will to her friend&#8217;s proposition, and Mrs.
Dearborn was much pleased and thankful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery is a true creature of impulse,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;that is really her predominating characteristic,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
and she will want to bound to the ceiling
when she hears she is to go to Sadler&#8217;s. She is
not at home now, but she will be in very soon.
You must take luncheon with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>About a quarter of an hour after that Margery
Dearborn came home. She was very glad indeed
to see the Archibalds, whom she remembered as
the kindest of people; and when she heard they
were going to take her to Sadler&#8217;s, she gave a
scream of delight and threw herself upon Mrs.
Archibald&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an angel,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;an angel of
blessedness, my dear Aunt Harriet! Don&#8217;t you
remember, I used to call you that? Won&#8217;t you
let me call you so still?&#8221; And without waiting
for an answer, she rushed to Mr. Archibald, with
outstretched hands. &#8220;Dear Uncle Archibald, you
are just as good as ever, I see. You know, I
wouldn&#8217;t call you Uncle Hector, because hectoring
meant scolding, which never had anything
to do with you. Sadler&#8217;s! Oh, when do we
start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow is Saturday,&#8221; replied Mr. Archibald;
&#8220;we must get together some things we
will need for camp-life, and we can start on Monday.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the visitors were left to themselves for
a few moments, Mr. Archibald said to his wife,
&#8220;Harriet, I am astounded. This girl, who used
to ride bareback and jump over fences, is a young
lady now, and a handsome one, too. She is quite
a different person from the girl I agreed to take
with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Archibald,&#8221; said his wife, &#8220;you never can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
remember that in this world people of all ages
grow older. She was fourteen when she was visiting
us, and that was four years ago, so of course
she is a young lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel that I am
growing any older, and I don&#8217;t see that you are,
and so I totally forget that proclivity in other
people. But what do you think now? Can we
take this young woman with us to camp? Will
she not be a dreadful drag?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;I much prefer
the young lady to the girl. I don&#8217;t want to be
the only woman in camp, and the nearer the other
woman is to my age the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald; &#8220;if you are
satisfied, I am; and, if she will agree to it, we will
add our ages for the time being, and divide by
three, and then we will all stand on a level.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>SADLER&#8217;S</h3>
</div>

<p>It was in the afternoon of Monday, the 11th of
June, when Mr. and Mrs. Archibald, accompanied
by Miss Margery Dearborn, arrived at Sadler&#8217;s,
and with feelings of relief alighted from the
cramped stage-coach which had brought them
eight miles from the railroad station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can this be Sadler&#8217;s?&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, in
a tone of surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it must be,&#8221; said his wife, &#8220;since
they brought us here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is the place,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;for
there is the name over that door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel about it?&#8221; said Mr. Archibald
to his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very well about it,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Why
shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel about it?&#8221; he asked of the
younger lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly understand
it. I had visions of forests and wilds and
tumbling mountain streams and a general air of
primevalism, and I am surprised to see this fine
hotel with piazzas, and croquet-grounds, and tennis-courts,
and gravelled walks, and babies in their
carriages, and elderly ladies carrying sun-shades.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it seems to me that there is a forest behind
it,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Margery, a little dolefully, &#8220;it
has that to back it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us stand here at the bottom of the
steps talking,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;I must
say I am very agreeably surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the wide hall which ran through the middle
of the hotel, and not far from the clerk&#8217;s desk,
there sat a large, handsome man, a little past
middle age, who, in a hearty voice, greeted the
visitors as they entered, but without rising from
his chair. This was Peter Sadler, the owner of
the hotel, the legal owner of a great deal of the
neighboring country, and the actual ruler of
more of said country than could be easily marked
out upon a map or stated in surveyors&#8217; terms.</p>
<p>In fact, Peter Sadler, was king of that portion
of the vast district of mountain and forest which
could be reached in a day&#8217;s journey in any direction.
If he had wished to extend his domain to
points at a greater distance than this he would
have done so, but so far he was satisfied with the
rights he had asserted. He ruled supreme in
that region because he had lived longer in the
vicinity than any other white man, because he
had a powerful will which did not brook opposition,
and because there was no one to oppose
him.</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 400px;'>
&#8220;&#8216;CAN THIS BE SADLER&#8217;S?&#8217;&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>On the arable land which lay outside of the
forest, and which really belonged to him, there
were the houses of the men who farmed his
fields, and on the outskirts of the woods were
scattered here and there the cabins of the hunters
and guides he employed, and these men knew
no law but his will. Of course the laws of the
State covered the district, but such promulgation
and enforcement of these as he might consider
necessary were generally left to Peter Sadler,
and as to his own laws, he was always there
to see that these were observed.</p>
<p>His guests submitted themselves to his will, or
they left his hotel very soon. To people of discernment
and judgment it was not difficult to
submit to the will of this full-bearded, broad-chested
man, who knew so much better than they
did what they ought to do if they wanted to get
all the good out of Sadler&#8217;s which they were capable
of assimilating.</p>
<p>This man, who sat all day in a big rolling-chair,
and who knew everything that was going on in
the hotel, the farm, and the forest about him,
had been a hunter and a guide in his youth, an
Indian-fighter in later years, and when he had
been wounded in both legs, so that it was impossible
for him ever to walk again, he came back to
the scenes of his youth and established an inn for
sportsmen&mdash;a poor little house at first, which
grew and grew and grew, until it was the large,
well-kept hotel so widely known by his name.</p>
<p>After dinner, at which meal they were waited
upon by women, and not by men in evening-dress
as Margery had begun to fear, Mr. Archibald
sought Peter Sadler and made known to him the
surprise of his party at finding themselves in this
fine hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you expect?&#8221; asked Peter, eying
him from head to foot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;From what we had heard,&#8221; replied the other,
&#8220;we supposed we should find some sort of a preparatory
camping-ground in the woods, from
which we could go out and have a camp of our
own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what you have found,&#8221; said Sadler.
&#8220;In this house you prepare to camp, if you need
preparation. If any man, woman, or child comes
here and wants to go out to camp, and I see that
they are sickly or weak or in any way not fit to
live in the woods, I don&#8217;t let them go one step
until they are fit for it. The air and the food
and the water they get here will make them fit,
if anything will do it, and if these three things
don&#8217;t set them up they simply have to go back
where they came from. They can&#8217;t go into camp
from this house. But if they fancy this hotel&mdash;and
there isn&#8217;t any reason why anybody shouldn&#8217;t
fancy it&mdash;they can stay here as long as they like,
and I&#8217;ll take care of them. Now, sir, if you want
to go into camp, the first thing for you to do is to
bring your family here and let me take a look at
them. I&#8217;ve seen them, of course, but I haven&#8217;t
made up my mind yet whether they are the right
sort for camp life. As for you, I think you will
do. There isn&#8217;t much of you, but you look
tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s good rough
talk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and smacks more of camp life than
anything I have noticed here. I will go and bring
my wife and Miss Dearborn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is another reason why I want to see
them,&#8221; said the bluff Peter. &#8220;As you are bent on
camping, you&#8217;ll like to choose a camp, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
anything of that kind is on hand I want to talk
to the whole party. I don&#8217;t care to settle the
business with one of them, and then have him
come back and say that what has been agreed
upon don&#8217;t suit the others. I want a full meeting
or no session.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mr. Archibald returned with his wife and
Margery, he found Peter Sadler had rolled his
chair up to a large circular table at the back of
the hall, on which was spread a map of the forest.
He greeted the ladies in a loud voice and with a
cheery smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you want to go camping, do you?&#8221; said
he. &#8220;Sit down and let us talk it over. I think
the young lady is all right. She looks spry
enough, and I expect she could eat pine-cones
like a squirrel if she was hungry and had nothing
else. As for you, madam, you don&#8217;t appear
as if anything in particular was the matter with
you, and I should think you could stand a Number
Three camp well enough, and be all the better
for a week or two of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is a Number Three camp?&#8221; asked Margery,
before the astonished Mrs. Archibald could
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sadler, &#8220;it is a camp with a good
deal of comfort in it. Our Number One camps
are pretty rough. They are for hunters and
scientific people. We give them game enough
in season, and some bare places where they can
make fires and stretch a bit of canvas. That is
all they want, to have a truly good time. That
is the best camp of all, I think. Number Two
camps are generally for fishermen. They always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
want a chance for pretty good living when they
are out in the woods. They stay in camp in the
evenings, and like to sit around and have a good
time. Number Threes are the best camps we put
families into, so you see, madam, I&#8217;m rating you
pretty high. There&#8217;s always a log-cabin in these
camps, with cots and straw mattresses and plenty
of traps for cooking. And, more than that, there
is a chance for people who don&#8217;t tramp or fish
to do things, such as walking or boating, according
to circumstances. There&#8217;s one of our camps
has a croquet-ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t want that!&#8221; cried Margery, &#8220;it
would simply ruin every illusion that is left to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to hear that,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;If you want
to play croquet, stay at the hotel; that&#8217;s what I
say. Now, then, here are the camps, and there&#8217;s
plenty of them to choose from. You&#8217;ve come in
a good time, for the season isn&#8217;t fairly begun
yet. Next month every camp will be full, with
the hotel crowded with people waiting for their
turns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we want,&#8221; said Margery, rising and
looking over the map, &#8220;is the wildest Number
Three you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;Not so fast, miss;
perhaps we&#8217;ll wait and see what this lady has to
say first. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, madam, I think
you&#8217;re inclined the other way, and I don&#8217;t put
people into camps that they will be wanting to
leave after the first rainy day. Now let me show
you what I&#8217;ve got. Here is one, four hours&#8217; walk,
horses for women, with a rocky stream through
the middle of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is grand!&#8221; cried Margery. &#8220;Is it really
in the woods?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let me do the talking,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;They
are all in the woods; we don&#8217;t make camps in
pasture-fields. Even the Number Sevens, where
the meals are sent to the campers from the hotel,
and they have bath-tubs, are in the woods. Now
here is another one, about three miles west from
the one I just showed you, but the same distance
from here. This, you see, is on the shore of a
lake, with fishing, boating, and bathing, if you
can stand cold water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glorious!&#8221; cried Margery. &#8220;That is exactly
what we want. A lake will be simply heavenly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything seems to suit you, miss,&#8221; said
Peter, &#8220;just as soon as you hear of it. But suppose
we consider more of them before you choose.
Some two miles north of here, in the thickest of
the forest, in a clearing that I made, there is
a small camp that strikes the fancy of some people.
There is a little stream there and it has
fish in it too, and it runs through one corner of
the log-cabin, so there are seven or eight feet of
the stream inside the house, and on rainy days
you can sit there and fish; and some people like
to go to sleep with the running water gurgling
close to them where they can hear it when they
are in bed. Then there&#8217;s an owl to this camp.
The men heard him there when they were making
the clearing, and he&#8217;s never left the spot.
Some people who were out there said they never
felt as much away from the world as they did
listening to that little stream gurgling and that
owl hooting.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; exclaimed Margery, &#8220;that in a
place like that I could write poetry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would give me the rheumatism and the
blues,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, upon which Peter
Sadler exclaimed,</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles that. Now then, here is another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several other camps were considered, but it
was the general conclusion that the one by the
lake was the most desirable. It had a good cabin
with three rooms, with plenty of open space, near
by, for the tents of the guides; there was a boat
which belonged to the camp, and in every way it
seemed so suitable that Mr. Archibald secured it.
He thought the price was rather high, but as it
included guides, provisions, fishing-tackle, and in
fact everything needed, he considered that although
it might cost as much as lodgings in a
city hotel, they would get more good out of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has this camp any name?&#8221; asked the enthusiastic
Margery, in the course of the conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about your twenty-seventh question,
miss,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;but it&#8217;s one I can answer.
Yes, it&#8217;s got a name. It&#8217;s called Camp Rob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; ejaculated Margery, in a disappointed
tone. &#8220;What a name!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t much of a name.
The first people who went out there named it
that, and it stuck to it, and it&#8217;s all it&#8217;s got.
Camps are like horses&mdash;we&#8217;ve got to tell them
apart, and so we give them names, and that&#8217;s
Camp Rob.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A CATARACT OF INFORMATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Peter Sadler would have been glad to have
the Archibald party stay at his hotel for a few
days, and Mrs. Archibald would have been perfectly
satisfied to remain there until they were
ready to return to their own house, but her husband
and Margery were impatient to be in the
woods, and it was therefore decided to start for
the camp the next day. Peter Sadler was a man
of system, and his arrangements were made
promptly and rapidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to have a guide,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and
another man to help him, and I think I&#8217;ll give
you Phil Matlack. Phil is an old hand at the
business, and if you don&#8217;t know what you want,
he&#8217;ll tell you. If you are in Phil&#8217;s hands, you
needn&#8217;t be afraid anything will happen to you.
Whatever you want, ask him for it, and ten to
one he&#8217;ll have it, whether it&#8217;s information or fishhooks.
I tell you again, you&#8217;re lucky to be here
early and get the best of everything. Camp Rob
with Phil Matlack will stand at a premium in
three or four weeks from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evening after supper Mr. Archibald lighted
a cigar and went out into the grounds in front of
the hotel, where he was presently joined by his wife.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Margery?&#8221; asked he.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is in her room,&#8221; replied Mrs. Archibald,
&#8220;but she called to me that she would be down directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In about ten minutes down came Margery and
floated out upon the lawn. She was dressed in
white, with flowers in her hair, and she was more
charming, Mr. Archibald said, as she approached,
than even the sunset sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should not speak in that way of works of
nature,&#8221; said his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she a work of nature?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not altogether,&#8221; was the wise reply. &#8220;Why
did you dress yourself in that fashion?&#8221; she asked
Margery. &#8220;I did not suppose you would bring
such a fine gown, as we started out to go into
camp. And even in this hotel a travelling-suit
is good enough for any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I tucked this into one of my bags,&#8221; replied
Margery. &#8220;I always like to have something nice
to fall back upon. Don&#8217;t you want to take a little
stroll, Aunt Harriet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald leaned back in his garden-chair
and slowly puffed his cigar, and as he puffed he
took his eyes from the sunset sky and watched
his wife and Margery.</p>
<p>A little beyond them, as they walked, sat two
elderly ladies on a bench, wearing shawls, and
near by stood a girl in a short dress, with no hat
on, and a long plait down her back. A little
farther on was a tennis-court, and four people,
apparently young, were playing tennis. There
were two men, and neither of them wore a tennis-suit.
One was attired as a bicyclist, and the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
wore ordinary summer clothes. The young women
were dressed in dark-blue flannel and little
round hats, which suggested to Mr. Archibald
the deck of a yacht.</p>
<p>Near the hotel was an elderly gentleman walking
up and down by himself, and on the piazza
were the rest of the guests he had seen at the
table; not very many of them, for it was early in
the season.</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald now turned his eyes again to the
sky. It was still beautiful, although its colors
were fading, and after a time he looked back
towards his wife. She was now talking to the
two elderly ladies on the bench, and Margery was
engaged in conversation with the girl with the
plait down her back.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I finish my cigar,&#8221; thought Mr. Archibald,
&#8220;I will go myself and take a stroll.&#8221; And
it struck him that he might talk to the old gentleman,
who was still walking up and down in
front of the hotel. After contemplating the tops
of some forest trees against the greenish-yellow
of the middle sky, he turned his eyes again towards
his wife, and found that the two elderly
ladies had made room for her on the bench, that
the tennis-game had ceased, and that one of the
girls in blue flannel had joined this group and
was talking to Margery.</p>
<p>In a few moments all the ladies on the bench
rose, and Mrs. Archibald and one of them walked
slowly towards an opening in the woods. The
other lady followed with the little girl, and Margery
and the young woman in blue walked in the
same direction, but not in company with the rest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
of the party. The two young men, with the
other tennis-player between them, walked over
from the tennis-court and joined the first group,
and they all stopped just as they reached the
woods. There they stood and began talking to
each other, after which one of the young men
and the young woman approached a large tree,
and he poked with a stick into what was probably
a hole near its roots, and Mr. Archibald supposed
that the discussion concerned a snake-hole or a
hornets&#8217; nest. Then Margery and the other
young woman came up, and they looked at the
hole. Now the whole company walked into the
woods and disappeared. In about ten minutes
Mr. Archibald finished his cigar and was thinking
of following his wife and Margery, when the
two elderly ladies and Mrs. Archibald came out
into the open and walked towards the hotel.
Then came the little girl, running very fast as
she passed the tree with the hole near its roots.
In a few minutes Mrs. Archibald stopped and
looked back towards the woods; then she walked
a little way in that direction, leaving her companions
to go to the hotel. Now the young man
in the bicycle suit emerged from the woods, with
a girl in dark-blue flannel on each side of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Archibald,
and rising to his feet, advanced towards his wife;
but before he reached her, Margery emerged
from the wood road, escorted by the young man
in the summer suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word,&#8221; Mr. Archibald remarked,
this time to his wife, &#8220;that ward of ours is not
given to wasting time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It seems so, truly,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and I think her
mother was right when she called her a creature
of impulse. Let us wait here until they come
up. We must all go in; it is getting chilly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Margery and the young man
had reached them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said this creature of
impulse to her escort. &#8220;My uncle and aunt will
take care of me now. Aunt Harriet and Uncle
Archibald, this is Mr. Clyde. He saw a great
snake go into a hole over there just before supper-time,
and I think we ought all to be very
careful how we pass that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is very much danger after
nightfall,&#8221; said Mr. Clyde, who was a pleasant
youth with brown hair, &#8220;and to-morrow I&#8217;ll see
if I can kill him. It&#8217;s a bad place for a snake
to have a hole, just where ladies would be apt to
take their walks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the snake will trouble us much,&#8221;
said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;for we leave to-morrow.
Still, it would be a good thing to kill it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this there were a few remarks made
about snakes, and then Mr. Clyde bade them
good-evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;How in the world, Margery,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald,
&#8220;did you get acquainted so quickly with
that young man&mdash;and who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it all happened quite naturally,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;As we turned to go out of the woods he was the
gentleman nearest to me, and so of course he
came with me. Those two girls are sisters, and
their name is Dodworth. They introduced Mr.
Clyde and the other gentleman, Mr. Raybold, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
me. But that was after you had been talking to
Mrs. Dodworth, their mother, who is Mr. Raybold&#8217;s
aunt. The other lady, with the shawl on,
is Mrs. Henderson, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;she&#8217;s
grandmother to that girl in the short dress!
She doesn&#8217;t begin to look old enough. The Dodworths
don&#8217;t go into camp at all, but expect to
stay here for two weeks longer, and then they go
to the sea-shore. Mrs. Henderson leaves day
after to-morrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Clyde and his friend live in Boston.
They are both just beginning to practise law,
though Mr. Clyde says that Mr. Raybold would
rather be an actor, but his family objects. The
old gentleman who is walking up and down in
front of the hotel has heart-disease, some people
say&mdash;but that is not certain. He stayed here all
last summer, and perhaps he will this year. In
two weeks hardly any of the people now in this
hotel will be here. One family is going into
camp when the father and two sons come on to
join them, and the rest are going to the sea-shore,
except one lady. You may have noticed her&mdash;the
one with a dark-purple dress and a little purple
cap. She&#8217;s a school-teacher, and she will
spend the rest of the summer with her sister in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man Phil Matlack, who is going with us
to-morrow, is quite a character, and I expect I shall
like him awfully. They say that about five years
ago he killed a man who made an attack on him
in the woods, but he was never tried for it, nor
was anything whatever done to him, because Mr.
Sadler said he was right, and he would not have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
any nonsense about it. There are people about
here who believe that Phil Matlack would fight a
bear single-handed if it happened to be necessary.
Mr. Sadler would do it himself if he could walk.
Nobody knows how many men he killed when
he was fighting Indians; and, would you believe
it? his wife is a plain, little, quiet woman, who
lives in some part of the hotel where nobody ever
sees her, because she is rather bashful and dislikes
company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other person who is going with us is not
very much more than a boy, though they say he
is very strong and a good hunter. His name is
Martin Sanders, and I forgot to say that the old
gentleman with the heart-disease is named Parker.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s generally thought that Phil Matlack would
rather have some one else than Martin Sanders
to go with him, because he says Martin knows
too much. The fact is that Martin is well educated,
and could have gone into some good business,
but he was so fond of the woods that he
gave up everything to come out here and learn
guiding. You know we were told that our camp
in the woods has three rooms in it? Well, it
really has four, for there was an artist there last
year who built a little room for a studio for rainy
days. I expect Mr. Sadler forgot that, or didn&#8217;t
think it worth counting. There are no snakes at
all where we are going to camp, but two miles
farther on there are lots of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the brink of Niagara,&#8221; interjected Mr.
Archibald, &#8220;they say eighteen million cubic feet
of water pour every minute. Where on earth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
Margery, did you fill your mind with all that information?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got it from those two Dodworth girls and
Mr. Clyde,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Mr. Raybold told me
some things, too, but mostly about his bicycle.
He feels badly about it, because he brought it
here, and now he finds there is no place to use it.
I should think he ought to have known that the
primeval forest isn&#8217;t any place for a bicycle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Archibald,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, when
they had retired to their room, &#8220;I did not agree
with you when you wished we could have started
for camp to-day, but now I am quite of your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tuesday was fine, and preparations were made
for the Archibald party to start for their camp
after an early luncheon.</p>
<p>The bluff and hearty Peter took such an interest
in everything that was being done for their
comfort, giving special heed to all the possible requirements
of Mrs. Archibald, that the heart of
Mr. Archibald was touched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said he to his good-natured host,
&#8220;that you were going with us. I do not know
any one I would rather camp with than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could do it,&#8221; replied Peter, &#8220;I&#8217;d like it
ever so well. So far as I have been able to make
you out, you are the sort of a man I&#8217;d be willing
to run a camp for. What I like about you is that
you haven&#8217;t any mind of your own. There is
nothing I hate worse than to run against a man
with a mind of his own. Of course there have to
be such fellows, but let them keep away from me.
There is no room here for more than one mind,
and I have pre-empted the whole section.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>Mr. Archibald laughed. &#8220;Your opinion of me
does not sound very complimentary,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is complimentary!&#8221; roared Peter Sadler,
striking the table with his fist. &#8220;Why, I tell you,
sir, I couldn&#8217;t say anything more commendable
of you if I tried! It shows that you are a man
of common-sense, and that&#8217;s pretty high praise.
Everything I&#8217;ve told you to do you&#8217;ve done.
Everything I&#8217;ve proposed you&#8217;ve agreed to. You
see for yourself that I know what is better for
you and your party than you do, and you stand
up like a man and say so. Yes, sir; if a rolling-chair
wasn&#8217;t as bad for the woods as the bicycle
that Boston chap brought down here, I&#8217;d go along
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald had a very sharp sense of the
humorous, and in his enjoyment of a comical situation
he liked company. His heart was stirred
to put his expedition in its true light before this
man who was so honest and plain-spoken. &#8220;Mr.
Sadler,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if you will take it as a piece of
confidential information, and not intended for
the general ear, I will tell you what sort of a
holiday my wife and I are taking. We are on a
wedding-journey.&#8221; And then he told the story
of the proxy bridal tour.</p>
<p>Peter Sadler threw himself back in his chair
and laughed with such great roars that two hunting-dogs,
who were asleep in the hall, sprang to
their feet and dashed out of the back door, their
tails between their legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the Lord Harry!&#8221; cried Peter Sadler,
&#8220;you and your wife are a pair of giants. I don&#8217;t
say anything about that young woman, for I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
don&#8217;t believe it would have made any difference
to her whether you were on a wedding-trip or
travelling into the woods to bury a child. I tell
you, sir, you mayn&#8217;t have a mind that can give
out much, but you&#8217;ve got a mind that can take in
the biggest kind of thing, and that is what I call
grand. It is the difference between a canyon and
a mountain. There are lots of good mountains
in this world, and mighty few good canyons.
Tom, you Tom, come here!&#8221;</p>
<p>In answer to the loud call a boy came running
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go into my room,&#8221; said Peter Sadler, &#8220;and
bring out a barrel bottle, large size, and one of
the stone jars with a red seal on it. Now, sir,&#8221;
said he to Mr. Archibald, &#8220;I am going to give you
a bottle of the very best whiskey that ever a
human being took into the woods, and a jar of
smoking-tobacco a great deal too good for any
king on any throne. They belong to my private
stock, and I am proud to make them a present to
a man who will take a wedding-trip to save his
grown-up daughter the trouble. As for your wife,
there&#8217;ll be a basket that will go to her with my
compliments, that will show her what I think of
her. By-the-way, sir, have you met Phil Matlack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have not!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Archibald,
with animation. &#8220;I have heard something about
him, and before we start I should like to see the
man who is going to take charge of us in camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there he is, just passing the back door.
Hello, Phil! come in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the eminent guide, Phil Matlack, entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
the hall, Mr. Archibald looked at him with some
surprise, for he was not the conventional tall,
gaunt, wiry, keen-eyed backwoodsman who had
naturally appeared to his mental vision. This
man was of medium height, a little round-shouldered,
dressed in a gray shirt, faded brown trousers
very baggy at the knees, a pair of conspicuous
blue woollen socks, and slippers made of carpet.
His short beard and his hair were touched with
gray, and he wore a small jockey cap. With the
exception of his eyes, Mr. Matlack&#8217;s facial features
were large, and the expression upon them
was that of a mild and generally good-natured
tolerance of the world and all that is in it. It
may be stated that this expression, combined with
his manner, indicated also a desire on his part
that the world and all that is in it should tolerate
him. Mr. Archibald&#8217;s first impressions of the
man did not formulate themselves in these terms;
he simply thought that the guide was a slipshod
sort of a fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil,&#8221; said Mr. Sadler, &#8220;here is the gentleman
you are going to take into camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see him,&#8221; said Matlack; &#8220;hope he&#8217;ll
like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want to say to you, Phil,&#8221; continued Sadler,
&#8220;right before him, that he is a first-class man
for you to have in charge. I don&#8217;t believe you
ever had a better one. He&#8217;s a city man, and it&#8217;s
my opinion he don&#8217;t know one thing about hunting,
fishing, making a camp-fire, or even digging
bait. I don&#8217;t suppose he ever spent a night outside
of a house, and doesn&#8217;t know any more about
the weather than he does about planting cabbages.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
He&#8217;s just clean, bright, and empty, like a
new peach-basket. What you tell him he&#8217;ll know,
and what you ask him to do he&#8217;ll do, and if you
want a better man than that to take into camp,
you want too much. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matlack looked at Peter Sadler and then at
Mr. Archibald, who was leaning back in his chair,
his bright eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you find out all that about him?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; exclaimed Peter Sadler. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you suppose I can read a man&#8217;s character when
I&#8217;ve had a good chance at him? Now how about
the stores&mdash;have they all gone on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were sent out early this mornin&#8217;,&#8221; said
Matlack, &#8220;and we can start as soon as the folks
are ready.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>CAMP ROB</h3>
</div>

<p>It was early in the afternoon when the Archibald
party took up the line of march for Camp
Rob. The two ladies, supplied by Mrs. Sadler
with coarse riding-skirts, sat each upon a farm-horse,
and Mr. Archibald held the bridle of the
one that carried his wife. Matlack and Martin
Sanders, the young man who was to assist him,
led the way, while a led horse, loaded with the
personal baggage of the travellers, brought up
the rear.</p>
<p>Their way wound through a forest over a wood
road, very rough and barely wide enough for the
passage of a cart. The road was solemn and
still, except where, here and there, an open space
allowed the sunlight to play upon a few scattered
wild flowers and brighten the sombre tints of the
undergrowth.</p>
<p>After a ride which seemed a long one to the
ladies, who wished they had attired themselves in
walking-costume, the road and the forest suddenly
came to an end, and before them stretched out
the waters of a small lake. Camp Rob was not
far from the head of the lake, and for some distance
above and below the forest stood back from
the water&#8217;s edge. In the shade of a great oak tree
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
there stood a small log-house, rude enough
to look at, but moderately comfortable within,
and from this house to the shore a wide space
was cleared of bushes and undergrowth.</p>
<p>The lake was narrow in proportion to its length,
which was about two miles, and on the other side
the forest looked like a solid wall of green reflected
in the water beneath. Even Mrs. Archibald,
whose aching back began to have an effect
upon her disposition, was delighted with the
beauty of the scene, which delight endured until
she had descended from her horse and entered
the log-cabin in which she was to dwell for a
time.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to describe the house, nor
is it necessary to dive into the depths of Mrs.
Archibald&#8217;s mind as she gazed about her, passing
silently from room to room of the little house.
She was a good woman, and she had made up her
mind that she would not be a millstone around
the necks of her companions. Many people have
been happy in camps, and, indeed, camp-life has
become one of the features of our higher civilization,
and this, from what she had heard, must
be a camp above the common. So, think what
she might, she determined to make no open complaint.
If it were possible for her to be happy
here, she would be happy.</p>
<p>As for Margery, no determination was needed
in her case. Everything was better than she had
expected to find it. The cabin, with the bark
on almost everything, even the furniture, was just
what a house in the woods ought to be; and
when she entered the little studio, which was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
nearer allied to the original forest than any other
part of the house, she declared that that must be
her room, and that living there she would feel
almost like a dryad in an oak.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve camped out before?&#8221; said Phil Matlack
to Mr. Archibald, as he was taking a survey of
the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been out a few
days at a time with fishing-parties, but we never
had such a fine camp as this&mdash;so well located and
such good accommodations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a fisherman, then?&#8221; said the guide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I am very fond of it. I&#8217;ve fished ever
since I was a boy, and know a good deal about
bait, in spite of what Mr. Sadler said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had an idea of that sort,&#8221; remarked Phil,
&#8220;but it ain&#8217;t no use to contradict Peter. It helps
keep up his spirits for him to think he can read
the characters of people just as quick as he can
aim a rifle. And it&#8217;s a mighty important thing
to keep Peter&#8217;s spirits up. If Peter&#8217;s spirits was
to go down, things round here would flatten out
worse than a rotten punkin when it&#8217;s dropped.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not take long to establish the new-comers
in their woodland quarters. The tent for the
two men, which had arrived in the morning, was
pitched not far from the cabin, and then Matlack
and Martin went to work to prepare supper. The
dining-room in pleasant weather was the small
space in front of the house, where there was a
table made of a wide board supported by stakes,
with a low and narrow board on each side, also
resting on stakes, and forming seats.</p>
<p>The supper was a better one and better served
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
than any of the party had expected. The camp
outfit included table-cloths, and even napkins.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said Matlack, as he brought a
dish of hot and savory broiled ham, &#8220;after Mr.
Archibald gets to work, we&#8217;ll have some fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald had been a little fearful that
under these primitive conditions the two men
might expect to sit at the table with them, but
she need have had no such fears. Matlack and
Martin cooked and waited with a skill and deftness
which would have surprised any one who did
not reflect that this was as much their business
as hunting or woodcraft.</p>
<p>After supper a camp-fire was built at a safe distance
from the house, for although the evening
air was but slightly cool, a camp without a camp-fire
would not be a camp. The party ranged
themselves around it, Mrs. Archibald on a rug
brought from the cabin, and her husband and
Margery on the ground. Mr. Archibald lighted
his pipe, the fire lighted the trees and the lake,
and joy inexpressible lighted the heart of Margery.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could smoke a pipe,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and get
Mr. Matlack to come here and tell me how he
killed a man, I should be perfectly happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night Mrs. Archibald lay awake on her
straw mattress. Absolute darkness was about
her, but through the open window she could see,
over the tops of the trees on the other side of the
lake, one little star.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could get any comfort out of that little
star,&#8221; thought the good lady, &#8220;I would do it; but
I can&#8217;t do it, and there is nothing else to comfort
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>On the other side of the room, on another straw
mattress, she could hear her husband breathing
steadily. Then, upon the bare boards of the floor,
which were but a few inches below her little cot-bed,
she thought she heard the patter of small
feet. A squirrel, perhaps, or, horrible to think
of, it might be a rat. She was sure rats would
eat straw beds, and her first impulse was to wake
Mr. Archibald; but she hesitated, he was sleeping
so soundly. Still she listened, and now she
became almost certain that what she heard was
not the patter of small feet; it sounded more like
something soft which was dragging itself over the
floor&mdash;possibly a snake. This idea was simply
awful, and she sat up in bed. Still she did not
call Mr. Archibald, for should he suddenly spring
on the floor, he would be in more danger from the
snake than she was.</p>
<p>She listened and she listened, but she heard
nothing more, and then her reason began to assure
her that a snake&#8217;s movements on a bare floor
would be absolutely noiseless; but in a moment
all thoughts of serpents were driven from her
head. Outside of the cabin she heard a sound
that could be nothing less than the footsteps of
some living creature&mdash;a wild beast, perhaps a
panther. The door was shut and fastened, but
the window was open. To call Mr. Archibald and
tell him a wild beast was walking outside the
house would be positively wicked. Half-awakened,
he would probably rush out of the door to
see what it was. What could she do? For an
instant she thought of lighting a candle and
standing it in the window. She knew that wild
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
beasts were afraid of fire, and she did not believe
that even a panther would dare jump over a
lighted candle. But if she struck a match and
got up, she would waken her husband; and, besides,
if the wind, of which she could feel a puff
every now and then, did not blow out the candle,
it might blow it over and set fire to the cabin.</p>
<p>She heard the footsteps no more, and lay down
again, but not to sleep. The wind seemed to be
rising, and made a wild, unearthly sound as it
surged through the trees which surrounded and
imprisoned her, and shut her out from the world
in which she was born and in which she ought to
live. There was a far-away sound which came
to her ears once, twice, thrice, and which might
have been the call of some ghostly bird or the
war-whoop of an Indian. At last she drew the
covering over her head, determined that, so long
as she could not see, she would not hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;A wedding-journey!&#8221; she said to herself, and
the idea, coupled with the sense of her present
grewsome and doleful condition, was so truly absurd
and ridiculous that she could not restrain a
melancholy laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, my dear?&#8221; exclaimed
Mr. Archibald, suddenly turning over in his bed.
&#8220;Are you choking? Is the room too close? Shall
I open the door?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for that was a laugh
you heard. I couldn&#8217;t help laughing at the
thought that there should be two such idiots in
the world as you and myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is idiotic, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Mr. Archibald. &#8220;It
is gloriously idiotic, and it will do us both a world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
of good. It is such a complete and perfect change
that I don&#8217;t wonder you laugh.&#8221; Then he laughed
himself, clearly and loudly, and turned over on
his side and went to sleep.</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald felt certain that she would not
sleep another wink that night, but she did sleep
seven hours and a half, and was awakened by
Margery singing outside her window.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>CAMP ROY</h3>
</div>

<p>No thoughts of idiocy crossed the minds of any
of the camping party during their first breakfast
under the great oak-tree. The air, the sunlight,
the rippling waters of the lake, the white clouds
in the blue sky, the great trunks of the trees, the
rustling of the leaves, the songs of the birds, the
hum of insects, the brightness of everything, their
wonderful appetites&mdash;the sense of all these things
more than filled their minds.</p>
<p>For the greater part of that day Mr. Archibald
fished, sometimes in a stream which ran into the
head of the lake about a quarter of a mile above
the camp, and sometimes on the shores of the lake
itself. Margery sketched; her night in the studio
had filled her with dreams of art, and she had discovered
in a corner a portable easel made of hickory
sticks with the bark on, and she had tucked
some drawing materials into one of her bags.</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald was a little tired with her
journey of the day before, and contented herself
with sitting in the shade in pleasant places,
occupied with some needle-work she had brought
with her, and trying to discipline her mind to
habits of happiness in camp. This was not very
difficult during the first part of this beautiful day,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
but towards the end of the afternoon she began
to think less of the joys of a free life in the heart
of nature and more of the pleasure of putting on
her bonnet and going out to make some calls
upon her friends. In this state of mind it pleased
her to see Phil Matlack coming towards her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like a cup of tea, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It would
seem rather odd to have afternoon tea in the
woods, and I really don&#8217;t care for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can have &#8217;most anything in the woods,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Matlack, &#8220;that we can have anywhere
else, providin&#8217; you don&#8217;t mind what sort
of fashion you have it in. I thought it might be
sort of comfortin&#8217; to you to have a cup of tea.
I&#8217;ve noticed that in most campin&#8217; parties of the
family order there&#8217;s generally one or two of them
that&#8217;s lonesome the first day; and the fact is I
don&#8217;t count on anything particular bein&#8217; done on
the first day in camp, except when the party is
regular hunters or fishermen. It&#8217;s just as well
for some of them to sit round on the first day and
let things soak into them, provided it isn&#8217;t rain,
and the next day they will have a more natural
feelin&#8217; about what they really want to do. Now
I expect you will be off on some sort of a tramp
to-morrow, ma&#8217;am, or else be out in the boat; and
as for that young lady, she&#8217;s not goin&#8217; to sketch
no more after to-day. She&#8217;s got young Martin
out in the boat, restin&#8217; on his oars, while she&#8217;s puttin&#8217;
him into her picture. She&#8217;s rubbed him out
so often that I expect he&#8217;ll fall asleep and tumble
overboard, or else drop one of his oars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Matlack,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;will you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
please sit down a moment? I want to ask you
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said he, and forthwith seated
himself on a log near by, picking up a stick as
he did so, and beginning to shave the bark from
it with his pocket-knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said she, &#8220;if there are panthers
in these woods?&#8221;</p>
<p>Matlack looked up at her quickly. &#8220;I expect
you heard them walkin&#8217; about your cabin last
night,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and not only panthers, but
most likely a bear or two, and snakes rustlin&#8217; in
the leaves; and, for all I know, coons or &#8217;possums
climbin&#8217; in and out of the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing so bad as that,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I
only thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he interrupted. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
mean that you heard all those things, but most
likely a part of them. Hardly any family parties
goes into camp that some of them don&#8217;t hear wild
beasts the first night. But they never come no
more. Them kind of wild beasts I call first-nighters,
and they&#8217;re about the worst kind we&#8217;ve got,
because they really do hurt people by scratchin&#8217;
and clawin&#8217; at their nerves, whereas the real wild
beasts in these parts&mdash;and they&#8217;re mighty scarce,
and never come near camp&mdash;don&#8217;t hurt nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But what
on earth can be keeping Mr. Archibald? When
he started out after dinner he said he would be
back very soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s got the fever, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fever!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Archibald, dropping
her work in her lap.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be frightened,&#8221; said he; &#8220;it is only
the fishin&#8217; fever. It don&#8217;t hurt anybody; it only
keeps the meals waitin&#8217;. You see, we are pretty
nigh the first people out this year, and the fish
bite lively. Are you fond of fishin&#8217;, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; said she; &#8220;I dislike it. I think
it is cruel and slimy and generally unpleasant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you&#8217;ll spend most of your time in the
boat,&#8221; suggested Matlack. &#8220;Your husband rows,
don&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t row me,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald,
with earnestness. &#8220;I never go out in a boat except
with a regular boatman. I suppose you
have a larger boat than the one that young man
is in? I can see it from here, and it looks very
small.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Matlack; &#8220;that&#8217;s the only
one we&#8217;ve got. And now I guess I&#8217;ll go see about
supper. This has been a lazy day for us, but
we always do calc&#8217;late on a lazy day to begin
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me,&#8221; said Matlack to himself, as he
walked away, &#8220;that this here camp will come to
an end pretty soon. The man and the young
woman could stand it for a couple of weeks, but
there&#8217;s nothing here for the old lady, and it can&#8217;t
be long before she&#8217;ll have us all out of the woods
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can come in,&#8221; called Margery, about ten
minutes after this conversation; and young
Martin, who had not the least idea of going to
sleep in the boat, dipped his oars in the water
and rowed ashore, pulled the boat up on the
beach, and then advanced to the spot where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Margery was preparing to put away her drawing
materials.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind letting me see your sketch?&#8221;
said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said she; &#8220;but you&#8217;ll see it isn&#8217;t very
much like the scene itself. When I make a drawing
from nature I never copy everything I see
just as if I were making a photograph. I suppose
you think I ought to draw the boat just as
it is, but I always put something of my own
in my pictures. And that, you see, is a different
kind of a boat from the one you were in. It is
something like Venetian boats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t like anything in this part of the world,
that is true,&#8221; said the young man, as he held the
drawing in his hand; &#8220;and if it had been more
like a gondola it would not have suited the scene.
I think you have caught the spirit of the landscape
very well; but if you don&#8217;t object to a little
criticism, I should say that the shore over there
is too near the foreground. It seems to me that
the picture wants atmosphere; that would help
the distance very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you draw?&#8221; asked Margery, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to be very fond of sketching,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I stayed at Sadler&#8217;s a good part of the last
winter, and when I wasn&#8217;t out hunting I made a
good many drawings of winter scenes. I would
be glad to show them to you when we go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she, &#8220;if I had known you were an
artist I would not have asked you to go out there
and sit as a model.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am not an artist,&#8221; replied Martin; &#8220;I
only draw, that&#8217;s all. But if you make any more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
water sketches and would like me to put some
ducks or any other kind of wild-fowl in the foreground
I will be glad to do it for you. I have
made a specialty of natural-history drawings.
Don&#8217;t bother yourself about that easel; I&#8217;ll carry
up your things for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>About half-way to the cabin Margery suddenly
stopped and turned round towards the young
man, who was following her. &#8220;How did you come
to be a guide?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s because I was born a naturalist
and a sportsman. I went into business when
I finished my education, but I couldn&#8217;t stand
that, and as I couldn&#8217;t afford to become a gentleman
sportsman, I came here as a guide. I&#8217;m
getting a lot of experience in this sort of life, and
when I&#8217;ve saved money enough I&#8217;m going on an
exploring expedition, most likely to Central
America. That&#8217;s the kind of life that will suit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And write a book about it?&#8221; asked Margery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most likely,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>That night, after supper, Margery remarked:
&#8220;Our two guides are American citizens, and I
don&#8217;t see why they can&#8217;t eat at the table with us
instead of waiting until we have finished. We
are all free and equal in the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery Dearborn!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Archibald.
&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was going to say that if there were one
straw more needed to break her back, that straw
would be the sight of the two guides sitting at
the table with them, but she restrained herself.
She did not want Mr. Archibald to know anything
about the condition of her back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So long as they don&#8217;t want to do it, and don&#8217;t
do it,&#8221; said she, &#8220;pray don&#8217;t let us say anything
about it. Let&#8217;s try to make things as pleasant
as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald was lighting his pipe, and when
he was sure the tobacco was sufficiently ignited
he took the pipe from his mouth and turned
towards his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harriet,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you have been too much
alone to-day. I don&#8217;t know what I shall do to-morrow;
but whatever it is, I am going to take
you with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course that depends on what it is you do,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;But I will try to do everything
I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald heaved a little sigh, which was
not noticed by any one, because it sounded like
a puff.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;that this camping
business is not going to last very much longer,
and we shall be obliged to make the rest of our
wedding-journey in a different style.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning, when Mr. Archibald went
out of his cabin door, he looked over the lake and
saw a bird suddenly swoop down upon the water,
breaking the smooth surface into sparkles of silver,
and then rise again, a little silvery fish glittering
in its claws.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beautifully done!&#8221; said he. &#8220;A splendid
stroke!&#8221; And then turning, he looked up the
lake, and not far from the water&#8217;s edge he saw
Margery walking with Mr. Clyde, while Mr. Raybold
followed a little in the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harriet,&#8221; he cried, quickly stepping into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
cabin again, &#8220;look out here! What is the meaning
of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald was dressed, and came out.
When she saw the trio approaching them, she
was not so much surprised as was her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the meaning of anything that
happens in these woods,&#8221; she said; &#8220;but if a lot
of people have come from the hotel with those
young men I cannot say I am sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said her husband, &#8220;we must look into
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>In two minutes the Archibalds had met the
new-comers, who advanced with outstretched
hands, as if they had been old friends. Mr. Archibald,
not without some mental disquietude at
this intrusion upon the woodland privacy of his
party, was about to begin a series of questions,
when he was forestalled by Margery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Archibald and Aunt Harriet!&#8221; she
exclaimed, &#8220;Mr. Clyde and Mr. Raybold have
come out here to camp. Their camp is right
next to ours, and it is called Camp Roy. You
see, some years ago there was a large camping
party came here, and they called the place Camp
Rob Roy, but it was afterwards divided, and one
part called Camp Rob and the other Camp Roy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; interrupted Mr. Archibald. &#8220;Mr.
Sadler did not tell us that ours was only half a
camp with only half a name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose he thought of it,&#8221; said Margery.
&#8220;And the line between the two camps
is just three hundred feet above our cabin. I
don&#8217;t suppose anybody ever measures it off, but
there it is; and Mr. Clyde and Mr. Raybold have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
taken Camp Roy, which hasn&#8217;t any house on it.
They started before daybreak this morning, and
brought a tent along with them, which they have
pitched just back of that little peninsula; and
they haven&#8217;t any guide, because they want to attend
to their own cooking and everything, and
the man who brought the tent and other things
has gone back. They are going to live there just
like real backwoodsmen, and they have a boat of
their own, which is to be brought up from the
bottom of the lake somewhere&mdash;I mean from the
lower end of the lake. And, Aunt Harriet, may
I speak to you a moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>With this the young woman drew Mrs. Archibald
aside, and in a low voice asked if she thought
it would be out of the way to invite the two young
men to take breakfast with them, as it was not
likely they had all their cooking things in order
so early.</p>
<p>Five people sat down to breakfast under the
great oak-tree, and it was a lively meal. Mr.
Archibald&#8217;s mental disquiet, in which were now
apparent some elements of resentment, had not
subsided, but the state of his mind did not show
itself in his demeanor, and he could not help
feeling pleased to see that his wife was in better
spirits. He had always known that she liked
company.</p>
<p>After breakfast he took Matlack aside. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t understand this business,&#8221; said he. &#8220;When
I hired this camp I supposed we were to have it to
ourselves; but if there are other camps jammed
close against it we may be in the midst of a great
public picnic before a week is out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that camp over there isn&#8217;t much of a
camp,&#8221; replied the guide. &#8220;The fact is, it is only
the tail end of a camp, and I don&#8217;t suppose Peter
Sadler thought anybody would be likely to take
it just now, and so didn&#8217;t think it worth while to
speak of it. Of course it&#8217;s jammed up against
this one, as you say; but then the people in one
camp haven&#8217;t the right to cross the line into
another camp if the people in the other camp
don&#8217;t want them to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Line!&#8221; said Mr. Archibald. &#8220;It is absurd to
think of lines in a place like this. And I have no
intention of making myself disagreeable by ordering
people off my premises. But I would like
to know if there is another camp three hundred
feet on this side of our cabin, or three hundred
feet back of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Matlack, speaking promptly;
&#8220;there isn&#8217;t another camp between this and the
lower end of the lake. There&#8217;s a big one there,
and it&#8217;s taken; but the people aren&#8217;t coming until
next month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If a larger party had taken Camp Roy,&#8221; said
Mr. Archibald to his wife a little later, &#8220;I should
not mind it so much. But two young men! I
do not like it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A STRANGER</h3>
</div>

<p>It was at the close of a pleasant afternoon four
days after the arrival of the young men at Camp
Roy, and Mrs. Archibald was seated on a camp-stool
near the edge of the lake intently fishing.
By her side stood Phil Matlack, who had volunteered
to interpose himself between her and all
the disagreeable adjuncts of angling. He put
the bait upon her hook, he told her when her cork
was bobbing sufficiently to justify a jerk, and
when she caught a little fish he took it off the
hook. Fishing in this pleasant wise had become
very agreeable to the good lady, and she found
pleasures in camp life which she had not anticipated.
Her husband was in a boat some distance
out on the lake, and he was also fishing, but she
did not care for that style of sport; the fish were
too big and the boat too small.</p>
<p>A little farther down the lake Martin Sanders
sat busily engaged in putting some water-fowl
into the foreground of Margery&#8217;s sketch. A
critical observer might have noticed that he had
also made a number of changes in said sketch, all
of which added greatly to its merits as a picture
of woodland scenery. At a little distance Margery
was sitting at her easel making a sketch of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
Martin as an artist at work in the woods. The
two young men had gone off with their guns,
not perhaps because they expected to find any
legitimate game at that season, but hoping to
secure some ornithological specimens, or to get a
shot at some minor quadrupeds unprotected by
law. Another reason for their expedition could
probably have been found in some strong hints
given by Mr. Archibald that it was unwise for
them to be hanging around the camps and
taking no advantage of the opportunities for
sport offered by the beautiful weather and the
forest.</p>
<p>It was not long before Margery became convinced
that the sketch on which she was working
did not resemble her model, nor did it very much
resemble an artist at work in the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks a good deal more like a cobbler mending
shoes,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll keep it
for that. Some day I will put a bench under
him and a shoe in his hand instead of a sketch.&#8221;
With that she rose, and went to see how Martin
was getting on. &#8220;I think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;those dark
ducks improve the picture very much. They
throw the other things back.&#8221; Then she stopped,
went to one side, and gazed out over the lake.
&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if there is really any fun
in fishing. Uncle Archibald has been out in that
boat for more than two hours, and he has fished
almost every day since he&#8217;s been here. I should
think he would get tired of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Martin, looking up with animation.
&#8220;If you know how to fish, and there is good
sport, you never get tired of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know how to fish,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;and I do
not care about it at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how to fish?&#8221; said Martin. &#8220;Can
you make a cast with a fly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never tried that,&#8221; said she. &#8220;But I have
fished as Aunt Harriet does, and it is easy as can
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know anything about
fishing unless you have fished with a fly. That
is the only real sport. It is as exciting as a battle.
If you would let me teach you how to throw
a fly, I am sure you would never find fishing tiresome,
and these woods would be like a new world
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do it yourself, then?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I am paid to do other things,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;We are not sent here simply to enjoy
ourselves, though I must say that I&mdash;&#8221; And
then he suddenly stopped. &#8220;I wish you would
let me teach you fly-fishing. I know you would
like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery looked at the eager face turned towards
her, and then she gazed out over the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I might like it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
it wouldn&#8217;t be necessary for you to take that
trouble. Uncle Archibald has two or three times
asked me to go out with him, and of course he
would teach me how to fish as he does. Isn&#8217;t
that somebody calling you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Martin, rising; &#8220;it&#8217;s Phil. I suppose
it&#8217;s nearly supper-time.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they walked towards the camp, Margery in
front, and Martin behind her carrying the drawing-materials and the easel, Margery suddenly
turned.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;&#8216;THEY THROW THE OTHER THINGS BACK&#8217;&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was very good of you to offer to teach me
to fish with flies,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and perhaps, if Uncle
Archibald doesn&#8217;t want to be bothered, I may get
you to show me how to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s face brightened, and he was
about to express his pleasure with considerable
warmth; but he checked himself, and merely remarked
that whenever she was ready he would
provide a rod and flies and show her how to use
them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald had gone into the cabin, and
Margery went up to Matlack, who was on his
way to the little tent in which the camp cooking
was done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Mrs. Archibald tell you,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that
we have invited Mr. Clyde and Mr. Raybold to
supper to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>The guide stopped and smiled. &#8220;She told me,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know that it was altogether
necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you mean,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;that
they are here so much; but I don&#8217;t wonder;
they must do awfully poor cooking for themselves.
I don&#8217;t suppose they will bring anything
back that is good to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at this time of year,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I
shall be satisfied if they bring themselves home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked Margery,
quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Matlack, &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt the bicycle
fellow will always come back all right, but
I&#8217;m afeard about the other one. That bicycle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
chap don&#8217;t know no more about a gun than he
does about makin&#8217; bread, and I wouldn&#8217;t go out
huntin&#8217; with him for a hundred dollars. He&#8217;s
just as likely to take a crack at his pardner&#8217;s
head as at anything else that&#8217;s movin&#8217; in the
woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is dreadful!&#8221; exclaimed Margery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; returned the guide; &#8220;and if I had
charge of their camp he wouldn&#8217;t go out with a
gun again. But it will be all right in a day or
two. Peter will settle that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sadler, do you mean?&#8221; asked Margery.
&#8220;What&#8217;s he got to do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got everything to do with it,&#8221; said Matlack.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got everything to do with everything
in this part of the country. He&#8217;s got his
laws, and he sees to it that people stand by them.
One of his rules is that people who don&#8217;t know
how to use guns sha&#8217;n&#8217;t shoot in his camps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can he know about the people out
here in the woods?&#8221; asked Margery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, miss,&#8221; said Matlack, speaking slowly
and decisively, &#8220;Peter Sadler&#8217;s ways of knowing
things is like gas&mdash;the kind you burn, I mean.
I was a-visitin&#8217; once in a city house, and slept in
a room on the top floor, and there was a leak in
the pipe in the cellar, and that gas just went over
the whole house, into every room and closet, and
even under the beds, and I&#8217;ve often thought that
that was just like Peter&#8217;s way of doin&#8217; things and
knowin&#8217; things. You take my word for it, that
bicycle-man won&#8217;t go out huntin&#8217; many more
days, even if he don&#8217;t shoot his pardner fust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t go to-morrow,&#8221; thought Margery;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
and then she said to Matlack: &#8220;I think we ought
to know Mr. Sadler&#8217;s rules. Has he any more of
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they ain&#8217;t very many,&#8221; said Matlack. &#8220;But
there&#8217;s one I think of now, and that is that no woman
shall go out in a boat by herself on this lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is simply horrid!&#8221; exclaimed Margery.
&#8220;Women can row as well as men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say they can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Matlack. &#8220;I&#8217;m
only tellin&#8217; you what Peter&#8217;s rules are, and that&#8217;s
one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery made no reply, but walked away, her
head thrown back a little more than was usual
with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to keep my eye on her,&#8221; said Matlack
to himself, as he went to the cabin; &#8220;she&#8217;s never
been broke to no harness.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Mr. Raybold did not shoot Mr. Clyde, nor did
he shoot anything else. Mr. Clyde did shoot a
bird, but it fell into the water at a place where
the shore was very marshy, and it was impossible
for him to get it. He thought it was a heron,
or a bittern, or perhaps a fish-hawk, but whatever
it was, both ladies said that it was a great
pity to kill it, as it was not good to eat, and must
have been very happy in its life in the beautiful
forest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very cruel to shoot them when they are
not strictly game,&#8221; said Mr. Clyde, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t
believe I will do it. If I had the things to stuff
them with, that would be different, but I haven&#8217;t.
I believe fishing is just as much fun, and more
sensible.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do not!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Raybold. &#8220;I hold
that hunting is a manly art, and that a forester&#8217;s
life is as bold and free to him as it is to the birds
in the air. I believe I have the blood of a hunter
in me. My voice is for the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you will change your voice,&#8221; thought
Margery, &#8220;when Mr. Sadler takes your gun away
from you.&#8221; But she did not say so.</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald stood with his hands in his pockets
reflecting. He had hoped that these two
young men were inveterate hunters, and that
they would spend their days in long tramps. He
did not at all approve of their fishing. Fishing
could be done anywhere&mdash;here, for instance,
right at this very door.</p>
<p>Supper was over, and the five inhabitants of
Camps Rob and Roy had seated themselves
around the fire which Martin had carefully built,
keeping in view a cheery blaze without too much
heat. Pipes had been filled and preparations
made for the usual evening smoke and talk, when
a man was seen emerging from the woods at the
point where the road opened into the clearing
about the camp. It was still light, for these hungry
campers supped early, and the man could
be distinctly seen as he approached, and it was
plain that he was not a messenger from Sadler&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He was rather a large man, dressed in black,
and wearing a felt hat with a wide, straight brim.
Hanging by a strap from his shoulder was a small
leather bag, and in his hand he carried a closed
umbrella. Advancing towards the fire, he took
off his hat, bowed, and smiled. He wore no beard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
his face was round and plump, and his smile was
pleasant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening, ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; said he,
and his voice was as pleasant as his smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, and then
for a moment there was a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume,&#8221; said the new-comer, looking about
him, &#8220;that this is a camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a camp,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is so obvious,&#8221; said the man in black,
&#8220;that it was really unnecessary for me to allude
to it. May I ask to be allowed to sit down for a
few moments? I am fatigued.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this juncture Phil Matlack arrived on the
scene. &#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;have you any business
with anybody here? Who do you wish to
see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no business,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are a stranger to everybody here?&#8221;
interrupted Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I hope&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said the guide, quickly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
to ask you to move on. This is one of Peter
Sadler&#8217;s camps, and he has strict rules against
strangers stoppin&#8217; in any of them. If you&#8217;ve lost
your way, I&#8217;ll tell you that this road, if you don&#8217;t
turn to the right or the left, will take you straight
to Sadler&#8217;s, and there&#8217;s time enough for you to
get there before dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Matlack,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Archibald, who
had risen to her feet, &#8220;I want to speak to you!
It&#8217;s a shame,&#8221; she said, when the guide had approached
her, &#8220;to send that man away without
even giving him a chance to rest himself. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
may be a very respectable person on a walking
tour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he is on a walkin&#8217; tour,&#8221; said Matlack,
&#8220;and I guess he&#8217;s a regular tramp, and there&#8217;s no
orders we&#8217;ve got that&#8217;s stricter than them against
tramps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care who he is,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald,
&#8220;or what your rules are, but when a perfectly
good-mannered man comes to us and asks
simply to be allowed to rest, I don&#8217;t want him to
be driven away as if he were a stray pig on a
lawn. Mr. Archibald, shouldn&#8217;t he be allowed to
rest a while?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her husband rose and approached the stranger.
&#8220;Where are you going, sir?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>The man looked at Matlack, at Martin, who stood
behind him, and then at the rest of the company,
and after this comprehensive glance he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;From present appearances,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I think
I am going to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald laughed. &#8220;When do you expect
to get there?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said the other, reflectively,
&#8220;that I am always going there, and I suppose I
shall have to keep on doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, turning to
Matlack, &#8220;give him some supper, and let him
rest. There will be time enough for him to get
to Sadler&#8217;s after that. If Sadler has anything to
say against it, refer him to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir,&#8221; said Matlack, &#8220;if you say so.
I&#8217;m no harder on my fellow-bein&#8217;s than other
people, but rules is rules, and it isn&#8217;t for me to
break them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; said the stranger to Mr. Archibald,
&#8220;your words are more grateful to me than
the promise of food. I see that you consider me
a tramp, but it is a mistake. I am not a tramp.
If you will allow me, after I have eaten a little
supper&mdash;a meal which I must admit I greatly
need&mdash;I will explain to you how I happen to be
here.&#8221; And with a bow he walked towards the
table where Matlack and Martin had been eating
their supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what I think he is?&#8221; said Mr.
Clyde, when Mr. Archibald had resumed his seat
and his pipe. &#8220;I believe he is a wandering actor.
Actors always have smoothly shaven faces, and
he looks like one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Actor!&#8221; exclaimed Arthur Raybold. &#8220;That&#8217;s
nonsense. He&#8217;s not in the least like an actor.
Anybody could see by his tread and his air that
he&#8217;s never been on the stage. He&#8217;s more like a
travelling salesman. The next thing he&#8217;ll do
will be to pull out of that bag some samples of
spool thread or patent thimbles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are both wrong,&#8221; said Margery&mdash;&#8220;entirely
wrong. I have been looking at him, and I believe
he is a Methodist minister with a dead horse.
They ride circuits, and of course when their
horses die they walk. Just wait a little, and see
if I am not right.&#8221;</p>
<p>They waited a little, and then they waited a little
longer, and they had begun to be tired of waiting
before the stranger finished his meal and approached
the fire. His face was brighter, his
smile was more pleasant, and his step had a certain
jauntiness in it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you all,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for the very good
meal I have just enjoyed. I am now going to
go, but before I start I would like very much&mdash;indeed,
I crave it as a favor&mdash;to place myself
before you in my proper light. May I have
permission to do so, madam and sir?&#8221; he said,
addressing Mrs. and Mr. Archibald, but with a
respectful glance at the others, as if he would
not ignore any one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;Sit down
and tell us about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger seated himself with alacrity a little
back from the circle, and nearer to the young
men than to the Archibald party.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE BISHOP&#8217;S TALE</h3>
</div>

<p>The stranger placed his broad-brimmed hat on
the ground beside him, exposing a large round
head somewhat bald in front, but not from age,
and the rest of it covered with close-cut brown
hair. His black clothes fitted him very closely,
their extreme tightness suggesting that they had
shrunken in the course of wearing, or that he
had grown much plumper since he had come into
possession of them; and their general worn and
dull appearance gave considerable distance to the
period of their first possession. But there was
nothing worn or dull about the countenance of
the man, upon which was an expression of mellow
geniality which would have been suitably
consequent upon a good dinner with plenty of
wine. But his only beverage had been coffee,
and in his clear bright eye there was no trace of
any exhilaration, except that caused by the action
of a hearty meal upon a good digestion and
an optimistic disposition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad,&#8221; he said, looking about him
at the company, and then glancing with a friendly
air towards the two guides, who stood a little
back of Mr. Archibald, &#8220;to have this opportunity
to explain my appearance here. In the first place,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
I must tell you that I am a bishop whose diocese
has been inundated, and who consequently has
been obliged to leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Archibald; and Margery
looked at Mr. Clyde, with the remark:</p>
<p>&#8220;There! You see I was very near to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume this statement will require some
explanation,&#8221; continued the man in black, &#8220;and
I will make it presently. I am going to be exceedingly
frank and open in all that I say to you,
and as frankness and openness are so extremely
rare in this world, it may be that I shall obtain
favor in your eyes from the fact of my possessing
those unusual qualities. Originally I was a teacher,
and for a year or two I had a very good country
school; but my employment at last became
so repugnant to me that I could no longer endure
it, and this repugnance was due entirely to
my intense dislike for children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not at all to your credit,&#8221; observed
Mrs. Archibald; &#8220;and I do not see how you became
a bishop, or why you should have been
made one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was your diocese entirely meadow-land?&#8221; inquired
Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am coming to all that,&#8221; said the stranger,
with a smile of polite consideration towards Mrs.
Archibald. &#8220;I know very well that it is not at
all to my credit to dislike children, but I said I
would be honest, and I am. I do dislike them&mdash;not
their bodies, but their minds. Children, considered
physically, are often pleasant to the view,
and even interesting as companions, providing
their innate juvenility is undisturbed; but when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
their personalities are rudely thrown open by a
teacher, and the innate juvenility prematurely
exposed to the air, it is something so clammy,
so chilly to the mental marrow, that I shrink from
it as I would shrink from the touch of any cold,
clammy thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Horrible!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not sure,&#8221; observed Margery, &#8220;that there
is not some truth in that. I had a Sunday-school
class for a little while, and although I can&#8217;t say
there was a clamminess, there was&mdash;well, I don&#8217;t
know what there was, but I gave it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad,&#8221; said the man in black, &#8220;that my
candor is not sinking me in the estimation of
every one present; but even if it did, I am obliged
to tell the truth. I do not know what would have
become of me if I had not had the good-fortune to
catch the measles from a family with whom I was
spending Sunday in another town. As soon as
the disease plainly showed itself upon me my
school was broken up, and it was never gathered
together again, at least under me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must make my story brief, and can only say
that not long after this I found myself in another
town, where it became necessary for me to do
something to support myself. This was difficult,
for I am an indefinite man, and definiteness seems
necessary to success in any line. Happening one
day to pass a house with open lower windows, I
heard the sound of children&#8217;s voices speaking in
unison, and knowing that this must be a school,
I looked in, compelled entirely by that curiosity
which often urges us to gaze upon human suffering.
I found, however, that this was a kindergarten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
conducted by a young woman. Unobserved
by scholars or teacher, I watched the
proceedings with great interest, and soon became
convinced that kindergartening was a much less
repellent system of tuition than any I had known;
but I also perceived that the methods of the
young woman could be greatly improved. I
thought a good deal upon this subject after
leaving the open window. Soon afterwards, becoming
acquainted with the young person in
charge of the children, I offered to teach her a
much better system of kindergartening than she
was using. My terms were very low, and she
became my scholar. I soon learned that there
were other kindergartens in the town, and some
of the teachers of these joined my class. Moreover,
there were young women in the place who
were not kindergartners, but who would like to
become such, and these I also taught, sometimes
visiting them at their houses, and sometimes giving
my lessons in a room loaned by one of my
patrons. My system became very popular, because
it was founded upon common-sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was your system?&#8221; asked Mrs. Archibald.
&#8220;I am interested in kindergartens myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My object,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;was to make the
operation of teaching interesting to the teacher.
It struck me very forcibly that a continuance of
a few years in the present inane performances
called kindergartening would infallibly send to
our lunatic asylums a number of women, more or
less young, with more or less depleted intellects.
The various games and exercises I devised were
very interesting, and I am sure I had scholars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
who never intended to become kindergartners,
and who studied with me solely for their own advantage.
It was at this time that I adopted the
clerical dress as being more suitable to my vocation
than any other costume, and some one having
called me the bishop, the name soon became
popular, and I was generally known by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is your real name?&#8221; asked Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;you must excuse me
if I ask you to recall your question. I have a
good name, and I belong to a very good family,
but there are reasons why I do not at present
wish to avow that name. Some of these reasons
are connected with the report that I purposely
visited the family with the measles in order to
get rid of my school; others are connected with
the inundation of my diocese, of which I shall
speak; others refer to my present indefinite
method of life. There is reason to suppose that
the time is not far distant when my resumption
of my family name will throw no discredit upon
it, but that period has not yet arrived. Do you
press your question, madam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald; &#8220;it really makes
no difference; and out here in the woods a man
may call himself a bishop or a cardinal or anything
he likes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I will
continue to speak in figures, and call myself a
bishop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where I was brought up,&#8221; interpolated Phil
Matlack, still standing behind Mr. Archibald, &#8220;I
was taught that figures don&#8217;t lie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My good sir,&#8221; said the speaker, with a smile,
&#8220;in mathematics they don&#8217;t, in poetry and literature
they often do. Well, as I was saying, my
diocese extended itself, my revenues were satisfactory,
and I had begun to believe that I had
found my true work in life, when suddenly there
was a misfortune. There arrived in our town
three apostles of kindergartening&mdash;two of them
were women, and one was a man. They had
heard of my system, and had come to investigate
it. They did so, with the result that in an astonishingly
short time my diocese was inundated
with a flood of Froebelism which absolutely swept
me away. With this bag, this umbrella, and this
costume, which has now become my wardrobe, I
was cast out in all my indefiniteness upon a definite
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how did you get here?&#8221; asked Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had heard of Sadler and his camps,&#8221; said he;
&#8220;and in this beautiful month and in this beautiful
weather I thought it would be well to investigate
them. I accordingly went to Mr. Sadler&#8217;s,
where I arrived yesterday afternoon. I found
Mr. Sadler a very definite man, and, I am sorry
to say, that as he immediately defined me as a
tramp, he would listen to no other definition.
&#8216;You have no money to pay for food and lodgings,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;and you come under my tramp
laws. I don&#8217;t harbor tramps, but I don&#8217;t kick
them out into the woods to starve. For labor on
this place I pay one dollar and a half a day of
ten hours. For meals to day-laborers I charge
fifteen cents each. If you want your supper, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
can go out to that wood-shed and split wood for
one hour.&#8217; I was very hungry; I went out into the
wood-shed; I split wood for one hour, and at the
end of that time I had a sufficient meal. When I
had finished, Mr. Sadler sent for me. &#8216;Do you want
to stay here all night?&#8217; he said. &#8216;I do,&#8217; I answered.
&#8216;Go, then, and split wood for another hour.&#8217; I
did so, and it was almost dark when I had finished.
In the morning I split wood for my breakfast,
and when I had finished I went to Mr. Sadler
and asked him how much he would charge for
a luncheon wrapped in a piece of paper. &#8216;Seven
and a half cents,&#8217; he said. I split wood for half
an hour, and left Sadler&#8217;s ostensibly to return to
the station by the way I had come; but while I
had been at work, I found from the conversation
of some of the people that one of the camps was
occupied, and I also discovered in what direction
it lay. Consequently, after I had passed out of
the sight of the definite Peter Sadler, I changed
my course, and took a path through the woods
which I was told would lead to this road, and I
came here because I might just as well pass this
way as any other, and because, having set out to
investigate camp life, I wished to do so, and I
hope I may be allowed to say that although I
have seen but little of it, I like it very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; said Phil Matlack, walking around
the circle and approaching the stranger, &#8220;you
said, when you first came here, that you were
going to go, and the time has come when you&#8217;ve
got to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the other, looking up with a
smile; &#8220;if I&#8217;ve got there I&#8217;d better stop.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>Mr. Archibald and the young men laughed, but
Matlack and Martin, who had now joined him, did
not laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve barely time enough,&#8221; said the former,
&#8220;to get to Sadler&#8217;s before it is pitch-dark, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;but I am not
going back to Sadler&#8217;s to-night. I would rather
have no bed than split wood for an hour after
dark in order to procure one. I would prefer a
couch of dried leaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You come along into the road with this young
man and me; I want to talk to you,&#8221; said Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Matlack,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;don&#8217;t
be cruel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; said the guide. &#8220;I am the tenderest-hearted
person in the world; but even if you
say so, sir, I can&#8217;t let a stranger stay all night in
a camp that I&#8217;ve got charge of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Matlack,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Clyde,
&#8220;you haven&#8217;t got charge of our camp!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; said the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, this person can come over and
stay with us. We have a little tent that we
brought to put over the cooking-stove, and he
can sleep in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Matlack; &#8220;if you take him
out of this camp I haven&#8217;t anything to say&mdash;that
is, to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; said the stranger, rising, and
approaching Mr. Clyde, &#8220;I accept your offer with
pleasure, and thank you most heartily for it. If
you had proffered me the hospitality of a palace,
I could not be more grateful.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Clyde; &#8220;and I suppose it is
time for us to be off, so I will bid you all good-night.
Come along, Arthur. Come along, bishop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The face of the last-named individual beamed
with delight as he heard this appellation, and bidding
everybody good-night, and thanking them
for the kindness with which he had been treated,
he followed the two young men.</p>
<p>The three walked some little distance towards
Camp Roy, and then Clyde came running back
to speak to Margery, who was now standing by
herself watching the young moon descend among
the trees. Then Mr. Raybold also stopped and
came back to Margery, upon which the bishop
stopped and waited for them. In about ten minutes
he was joined by the two young men, and
the three proceeded to Camp Roy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one thing, Harriet,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald,
&#8220;which I wish you would speak to Margery
about. I don&#8217;t want her to get up so early and
go out for a morning walk. I find that those
young men are also early risers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will speak to her,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald;
&#8220;where is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there, talking to young Martin,&#8221; said
her husband. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t quite dark yet, but I
think it is time we were all in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite time,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Margery tells me
that that young guide, who is a handsome fellow,
is going to teach her how to fish with flies.
I wish you would sometimes take her out in the
boat with you, Mr. Archibald; I am sure that
you could teach her how to fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;I suppose I could,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
I also suppose I could pull her out of the water
the first time she hooked a big fish. It would be
like resting a boat on a pivot to put her into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t take her,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald,
decisively. &#8220;And you can&#8217;t take her with you
up the stream, because, of course, she can&#8217;t wade.
I don&#8217;t want her to get tired of camp-life, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid of the young men,&#8221; interrupted
her husband, with a laugh; &#8220;so long as there
are three of them there is no danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will not, if you don&#8217;t wish it, Aunt
Harriet,&#8221; said Margery, when Mrs. Archibald had
spoken to her about the early morning walks;
&#8220;and I will stay in my room until you call me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning, when Mrs. Archibald was
ready to leave the cabin, she did call Margery,
but received no answer. Then she went to the
little studio-room, and when she opened the door
she found its occupant leaning out of the window
talking to Mr. Clyde and Mr. Raybold, who
stood outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Aunt Harriet!&#8221; exclaimed
Margery, gayly. &#8220;Mr. Clyde has brought me
nearly an armful of birch-bark, all thin and
smooth. I am going to make a birch-bark bedspread
out of it. I&#8217;ll cover a sheet with these
pieces, you see, and sew them on. Then I can
have autographs on them, and mottoes, and when
I cover myself up with it I shall really feel like
a dryad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is what I have brought,&#8221; said Mr.
Raybold, holding up an armful of bark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you very much,&#8221; said Margery, taking
the mass, but not without dropping a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
many of the pieces. &#8220;Of course it was kind of him
to bring it,&#8221; she said to Mrs. Archibald, as they
left the room together, &#8220;but he needn&#8217;t have
bothered himself: I don&#8217;t want to sleep under a
wood-pile.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>MATLACK&#8217;S THREE TROUBLES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Have you asked those two young men to
breakfast again?&#8221; inquired Mr. Archibald, after
examining, with a moderate interest, the specimen
of birch-bark which Margery had shown him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, indeed,&#8221; said she, &#8220;they have had their
breakfast. They have been telling me about it.
The bishop got up very early in the morning and
cooked it for them. He&#8217;s a splendid cook, and
he found things in their hampers that they didn&#8217;t
know they had. They said his coffee was delicious,
and they have left him there in their
camp now, washing the dishes and putting everything
in order. And do you think, Uncle Archibald,
that it is going to rain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for it is sprinkling already.&#8221;</p>
<p>This proved to be the first bad day since the
Archibald party had gone into camp, and the rain
soon began to come down in a steady, practised
way, as if the clouds above were used to that
sort of thing and could easily keep it up all day.</p>
<p>As there was no place under roof to which
company could be conveniently invited, Margery
retired to her room and set herself diligently to
work on her birch-bark quilt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald established herself in the division
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
of the cabin which was intended to be used
as a sitting and dining room in bad weather, and
applied herself to some sewing and darning,
which had been reserved for just such a day as
this. Mr. Archibald, in a water-proof suit, tried
fishing for half an hour or so, but finding it both
unpleasant and unprofitable, he joined his wife,
made himself as comfortable as possible on two
chairs, and began to read aloud one of the novels
they had brought with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Clyde and Mr. Raybold had considerately
gone to their own camp when it began to rain,
hoping, however, that the shower would be over
in a short time. But the rain was not a shower,
and they spent the morning on their backs in
their tent, talking and smoking. Of course they
could not expect the bishop to depart in the rain,
so they had told him to make himself as comfortable
as he could in the little kitchen tent, and
offered him a pipe and a book. The first he declined,
as he never smoked, but the latter he accepted
with delight.</p>
<p>After the mid-day dinner Phil Matlack, in a
pair of high hunting-boots and an oil-skin coat,
came to Mr. Archibald and said that as there
was nothing he could do that afternoon, he would
walk over to Sadler&#8217;s and attend to some business
he had there.</p>
<p>&#8220;About the bishop?&#8221; asked Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly,&#8221; said Matlack. &#8220;I understand the fellow
is still over there with those two young men.
I don&#8217;t suppose they&#8217;ll send him off in the rain,
and as he isn&#8217;t in my camp, I can&#8217;t interfere. But
it may rain for two or three days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;and if we
want anything we&#8217;ll ask Martin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Matlack. &#8220;If there&#8217;s anything
to do that you don&#8217;t want to do yourself, you can
get him to do it; but if you want to know anything
you don&#8217;t know yourself, you&#8217;d better wait
until I come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Matlack presented himself before Peter
Sadler he found that ponderous individual seated
in his rolling-chair near the open door, enjoying
the smell of the rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Phil!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong at the
camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>The guide left his wet coat and cap on the little
piazza outside, and after carefully wiping his
feet, seated himself on a chair near the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s three things wrong,&#8221; said he. &#8220;In the
first place, there&#8217;s a tramp out there, and it looks
to me as if he was a-goin&#8217; to stick, if he can get
allowed to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he too big for you to bounce?&#8221; roared
Peter. &#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty story to come tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he ain&#8217;t,&#8221; said the other; &#8220;but I haven&#8217;t
got the bouncin&#8217; of him. He&#8217;s not in my camp.
The young men have took him in; but I expect
he&#8217;ll come over with them as soon as it&#8217;s done
rainin&#8217;, for when that happens they&#8217;re bound to
come themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Phil,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;is he dressed
in black?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he is,&#8221; said the guide.</p>
<p>Mr. Sadler slapped his hand on the arm of his
chair. &#8220;Phil Matlack,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;that&#8217;s my
favorite tramp. I never had a man here who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
paid his bill in work as he did. It was cash down,
and good money. Not a minute of wood-splitting
more or less than the market-price for meals
and bed. I&#8217;d like to have a tramp like that come
along about twice a week. But I tell you, Phil,
he ain&#8217;t no tramp. Couldn&#8217;t you see that? None
of them loafers ever worked as he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may not be a tramp,&#8221; said Matlack, &#8220;but
he&#8217;s trampin&#8217;. What are you goin&#8217; to do about
him? Let him stay there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doin&#8217; now?&#8221; asked Sadler.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s cookin&#8217; for those two young men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they need some one to do it for them,
and they didn&#8217;t want to go to the expense of a
guide. Let the parson alone for a day or two,
and if he does anything out of the way just you
take him by one ear and Martin take him by the
other and bring him to me. I&#8217;ll attend to him.
What&#8217;s the next trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s out of my camp, too,&#8221; said Matlack,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m bound to report it. The bicycle fellow
that you hired a gun to don&#8217;t know the fust thing
about usin&#8217; it, and the next thing you&#8217;ll hear will
be that he&#8217;s shot his pardner, who&#8217;s worth six of
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Sadler sat up very straight in his chair
and stared at the guide. &#8220;Phil Matlack,&#8221; he
shouted, &#8220;what do you take me for? I hired that
gun to that young man. Don&#8217;t you suppose I
know what I&#8217;m about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Matlack, &#8220;but the
trouble is he don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away man,&#8221; said Peter, with a contemptuous
sniff, &#8220;he&#8217;ll never hurt anybody. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
do you take me for? When he came to me and
wanted a gun, I handed him two or three, so that
he might choose one that suited him, and by the
way he handled them I could see that most likely
he&#8217;d never handled one before, and so I set
him up all right. He&#8217;s got a good gun, and all
the cartridges he&#8217;ll be likely to want; and the
cartridges are all like this. They&#8217;re a new kind
I heard of last winter, and I got a case from Boston
last week. I don&#8217;t see how I ever managed
to run my camps without them. Do you see that
shot?&#8221; said he, opening one end of a cartridge.
&#8220;Well, take one in your hand and pinch it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil did so, and it crumbled to dust in his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;When that load&#8217;s fired,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;all the
shot will crumble into dust. It wouldn&#8217;t do to
give raw hands blank-cartridges, because they&#8217;d
find that out; but with this kind they might sit
all day and fire at a baby asleep in its cradle and
never disturb it, provided the baby was deaf.
And he can&#8217;t use his pardner&#8217;s cartridges, for I
gave that fellow a twelve-bore gun and his is a
ten-bore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil grinned. &#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I suppose
I might as well make my mind easy, but if
that bicycle man hunts much he&#8217;ll get the conviction
borne in on him that he&#8217;s a dreadful bad
shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;ll give up shooting, which is what
is wanted,&#8221; said Sadler. &#8220;What&#8217;s your third
bother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That young woman has made up her mind to
go out in the boat by herself the very fust time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
she feels like it,&#8221; said Matlack; &#8220;she didn&#8217;t say so
with her mouth, but she said it with the back of
her head and her shoulders, and I want to know
if that rule of yours is going to hold good this
summer. Women is gettin&#8217; to do so many things
they didn&#8217;t use to that I didn&#8217;t know but what
you&#8217;d consider they&#8217;d got far enough to take
themselves out on the lake, and if you do think
so, I don&#8217;t want to get myself in hot water with
those people and then find you don&#8217;t back me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t want to get yourself into hot
water with me, Phil Matlack, you&#8217;d better get it
into your head just as soon as you can that when
I make a rule it&#8217;s a rule, and I don&#8217;t want people
comin&#8217; to me and talkin&#8217; about changes. Women
in my camp don&#8217;t go out in boats by themselves,
and it&#8217;s easy enough to have that rule kept if
you&#8217;ve got backbone enough to do it. Keep the
boat locked to the shore when it ain&#8217;t in use, and
put the key in your pocket, and if anybody gets
it that &#8217;ain&#8217;t any right to it, that&#8217;s your lookout.
Now that&#8217;s the end of your troubles, I hope.
How&#8217;s things goin&#8217; on generally in the camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well enough,&#8221; said Matlack. &#8220;I thought
at fust the old lady&#8217;d give out in a day or two,
but I&#8217;ve taught her parlor-fishin&#8217;, which she&#8217;s
took to quite lively, and she&#8217;s got used to the
woods. The boss, he sticks to fishin&#8217;, as if it was
office-work, and as for the rest of them, I guess
they&#8217;re all gettin&#8217; more and more willin&#8217; to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, one of them is a gal and the others isn&#8217;t,&#8221;
replied Matlack, &#8220;that&#8217;s about the p&#8217;int of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>During Matlack&#8217;s walk back the skies cleared,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
and when he reached the camp he found Mrs.
Archibald seated in her chair near the edge of
the lake, a dry board under her feet, and the
bishop standing by her, putting bait on her hook,
and taking the fish off of it when any happened
to be there. Out in the boat sat Mr. Archibald,
trusting that some fish might approach the surface
in search of insects disabled by the rain.
Farther on, at a place by the water&#8217;s edge that
was clear of bushes and undergrowth, Martin was
giving Miss Dearborn a lesson in fly-fishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a mighty good fisherman,&#8221; thought Matlack,
looking at the young fellow as he brought
his rod back from the water with a long graceful
sweep, and then, with another sweep and an easy
inclination of his body forward, sending the fly far
out on the smooth surface of the lake, &#8220;although
there ain&#8217;t no need to tell him so; and I don&#8217;t
wonder she&#8217;d rather stand and watch him than
try to do it herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walking up and down near the edge of the
wood were Messrs. Clyde and Raybold.</p>
<p>Phil smiled. &#8220;They don&#8217;t seem to be happy,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;I guess they&#8217;re hankerin&#8217; to
take a share in her edication; but if you don&#8217;t
know nothin&#8217; yourself, you can&#8217;t edicate other
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matlack directed his steps towards Mrs. Archibald;
but before he reached her he was met by
the bishop, who hurried towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be obliged to surrender my post to
you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;which will be greatly to the lady&#8217;s
satisfaction, I imagine, for I must appear a poor
attendant after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to leave us?&#8221; said Matlack. &#8220;You look
quite spruced up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop smiled. &#8220;You allude, I suppose,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;to the fact that my hat and clothes are
brushed, and that I am freshly shaved and have
on a clean collar. I like to be as neat as I can.
This is a gutta-percha collar, and I can wash it
whenever I please with a bit of damp rag, and
it is my custom to shave every day, if I possibly
can. But as to leaving you, I shall not do so this
evening. I have promised those young gentlemen
who so kindly invited me to their camp that
I would prepare their supper for them, and I
must now go to make the fire and get things in
readiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they engaged you as cook and general
help?&#8221; asked Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said the bishop, with a smile, &#8220;they
are kind and I am grateful, that is all.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A LADIES&#8217; DAY IN CAMP</h3>
</div>

<p>Two days after the rainy day in camp Mr.
Archibald determined to take the direction of
affairs into his own hands, so far as he should be
able. Having no authority over the two young
men at Camp Roy, he had hitherto contented
himself with a disapproval of their methods of
employing their time, which he communicated
only to his wife. But now he considered that, as
they were spending so much of their time in his
camp and so little in their own, he would take
charge of them exactly as if they belonged to
his party. He would put an end, if possible, to
the aimless strolls up and down the beach with
Margery, and the long conversations of which
that young woman had grown to be so fond, held
sometimes with both young men, though more
frequently with one. If Clyde and Raybold came
into the woods to lounge in the shade and talk to
a girl, they must go to some other camp to do it.
But if they really cared to range the forest, either
as sportsmen or lovers of nature, he would do his
best to help them; so this day he organized an
expedition to a low mountain about two miles
away, taking Matlack with him as guide, and inviting
the two young men to join him. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
had assented because no good reason for declining
had presented itself, and because Phil Matlack
earnestly urged them to come along and let
him show them what a real forest tramp was
like. Before his recent talk with Peter Sadler,
Phil would not have dared to go out into the
woods in company with the bicycle man.</p>
<p>The two ladies were perfectly willing to remain
in camp under the charge of Martin, who was
capable of defending them against any possible
danger; and as the bishop had agreed to take
charge of Camp Roy during the absence of its
occupants, Mr. Archibald planned for a whole
day&#8217;s tramp, the first he had taken since they
went into camp.</p>
<p>When Martin&#8217;s morning work was done he approached
the shady spot where the two ladies had
established themselves, and offered to continue
his lessons in fish-flying if Miss Dearborn so desired.
But Miss Dearborn did not wish to take
any lessons to-day. She would rest and stay
with Mrs. Archibald. Even the elder lady did
not care to fish that morning. The day was hot
and the shade was grateful.</p>
<p>Martin walked away dissatisfied. In his opinion,
there had never been a day more suitable
for angling; this was a day which would be free
from interruptions, either from two young fellows
who knew nothing about real game-fishing,
or from Matlack, who always called him away to
do something when he was most interested in his
piscatorial pedagogics. This was a day when he
could stand by that lovely girl, give her the rod,
show her how to raise it, wave it, and throw it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
and sometimes even touch her hand as he took it
from her or gave it back, watching her all the
time with an admiration and delight which no
speckled trout or gamy black bass had ever yet
aroused in him, and all this without fear that a
gentleman out on the lake might possibly be observing
them with the idea that he was more interested
in his work than the ordinary guide
might be supposed to be. But luck was against
him, and Martin, who did not in the least consider
himself an ordinary guide, walked up and
down in moody reflection, or grimly threw himself
upon the ground, gazing upward at the sky&mdash;not
half so blue as he was&mdash;but never walking or
resting so far away that he could not hear the
first cry from her should snake, bear, dragon-fly,
or danger of any kind approach her.</p>
<p>To the ladies, about half an hour later, came
the bishop, who, newly shaved and brushed, wished
them good-morning, and offered his services in
any manner which might be desired. If Mrs.
Archibald wished to fish by the side of the lake,
he was at her service; but Mrs. Archibald did not
care to fish.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a most charming day,&#8221; said the
bishop, removing his hat, &#8220;but I suppose it is
more charming to me because it is my last day
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you are really going to go?&#8221; said Mrs.
Archibald, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you think I am not likely to get
there,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but really I have stayed here
long enough, and for several reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;and tell us what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
they are. There is a nice little rock with some
moss on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop promptly accepted the invitation
and seated himself. As he did so, Martin, at a little
distance, scowled, folded his arms, and slightly
increased the length of his sentinel-like walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the bishop, brushing some pine
leaves from his threadbare trousers, &#8220;during the
time that I have accepted the hospitality of those
young gentlemen I feel that I have in a great
measure repaid them for their kindness, but now
I see that I shall become a burden and an expense
to them. In the first place, I eat a great
deal more than both of them put together, so that
the provisions they brought with them will be
exhausted much sooner than they expected. I
am also of the opinion that they are getting tired
of eating in their own camp, but as I make a point
of preparing the meals at stated hours, of course
they feel obliged to partake of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By which you mean, I suppose,&#8221; said Mrs.
Archibald, &#8220;that if they had not you to cook for
them they would be apt to take a good many
meals with us, as they did when they first came,
and which would be cheaper and pleasanter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg, madam,&#8221; said the bishop, quickly, &#8220;that
you will not think that they have said anything
of the sort. I simply inferred, from remarks I
have heard, that one of them, at least, is very
much of the opinion you have just stated; therefore
I feel that I cannot be welcome much longer
in Camp Roy. There is also another reason why
I should go now. I have a business prospect before
me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear that,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald.
&#8220;Is it a good one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is,&#8221; said the bishop. &#8220;I have been
considering it earnestly, and the more I fix my
mind upon it the greater appear its advantages.
I don&#8217;t mind in the least telling you what it is.
A gentleman who is acquainted with my family
and whom I have met two or three times, but not
recently, possesses a very fine estate some thirty
miles south of this place. He has been in Europe
for some time, but is expected to return to his
country mansion about the end of this week. It
is my purpose to offer myself to him in the capacity
of private librarian. I do not think it will
be difficult to convince him that I have many
qualifications for the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he so many books that he needs a librarian?&#8221;
asked Margery.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;I have no reason to
suppose that he has any more books than the ordinary
country gentleman possesses, but he ought
to have. He has a very large income, and is now
engaged in establishing for his family what is intended
to become, in time, an ancestral mansion.
It is obvious to any one of intelligence that such
a grand mansion would not be complete without
a well-selected library, and that such a library
could not be selected or arranged by an ordinary
man of affairs. Consequently, unless he has a
competent person to perform this duty for him,
his library, for a long time, will be insignificant.
When I shall put the question before him, I have
no doubt that he will see and appreciate the force
and value of my statements. Such a position
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
will suit me admirably. I shall ask but little salary,
but it will give me something far better than
money&mdash;an opportunity to select from the book
marts of the whole world the literature in which
I delight. Consequently, you will see that it is
highly desirable that I should be on hand when
this gentleman arrives upon his estate.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a look of gentle pity Mrs. Archibald gazed
at the smooth round face of the bishop, flushed
with the delights of anticipation and brightened
by the cheery smile which nearly always accompanied
his remarks. &#8220;And is that your only prospect?&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to discourage
you, but it seems to me that if you had some regular
business&mdash;and you are not too old to learn
something of the sort&mdash;it would be far better for
you than trying to obtain the mythical position
you speak of. I see that you are a man of intelligence
and education, and I believe that you
would succeed in almost any calling to which you
would apply yourself with earnestness and industry.
You must excuse me for speaking so
plainly, but I am much older than you are and I
do it for your good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; exclaimed the bishop, radiant with
grateful emotion, &#8220;I thank you from the bottom
of my heart for what you have said. I thank you
for your appreciation of me and for the generous
motive of your words, but, to be frank with you,
I am not suited to a calling such as you have
mentioned. I have many qualities which I well
know would promote my fortunes were they
properly applied, but that application is difficult,
for the reason that my principal mental characteristic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
is indefiniteness. When but a little child I
was indefinite. Nobody knew what I was going
to do, or how I would turn out; no one has since
known, and no one knows now. In whatever
way I have turned my attention in my endeavors
to support myself, I have been obstructed and
even appalled by the definiteness of the ordinary
pursuits of life. Now the making of a private library
is in itself an indefinite occupation. It has
not its lines, its rules, its limitations. But do not
think, kind lady, that I shall always depend upon
such employment. Should I obtain it, I should
hold it only so long as it would be necessary, and
it may be necessary for but a little while. Do
you care to hear of my permanent prospects?&#8221;
said he, looking from one lady to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;we would like to
hear all you have to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; said the bishop, folding his arms
and smiling effusively, but with a gentle curbing
of his ordinary cheerfulness, &#8220;I will inform you
that I have an uncle who is a man of wealth and
well on in years. Unfortunately, or fortunately
it may be, this uncle greatly dislikes me. He
objects so strongly to my methods of thought
and action, and even to my physical presence,
that he cannot bear to hear me speak or even to
look at me, and the last time I was in his company,
about four years ago, he told me that he
would leave me a legacy on condition that he
should never hear from me or see me again. He
promised to make the proper provision in his will
immediately, but declared, and I know he will
keep his word, that if he ever received a letter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
from me or even saw me or heard my voice he
would instantly strike out that clause. I appreciated
and respected his feelings, and accepted the
condition. From that moment I have not written
to him, nor shall I ever write to him, and I shall
never go near him so long as he is alive. As I
said, he is of advanced age, and it is impossible
that he can long survive. When his demise takes
place my circumstances will, I believe, be satisfactory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did your uncle say how much he would leave
you?&#8221; asked Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, madam,&#8221; returned the other, &#8220;he did not,
but I feel sure that the sum will be measured
by his satisfaction in knowing that his existence
is entirely freed from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;there is nothing
about you so indefinite as your prospects.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it seems horrible to me,&#8221; said Margery,
&#8220;to be hoping that some one may die in order
that you may be better off, for, as you want
money so much, you must hope that your uncle
will die.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop smiled and rose. &#8220;And now,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;I suppose I must go to prepare the dinner
at Camp Roy. There is nobody but myself to
eat it, but I have assumed the duty, and it must
be performed. Good-morning. By your leave, I
shall look in upon you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald had a mind to ask him to stay
and dine with them, but having noticed an unfriendly
expression on the face of Martin when
his gloomy walk brought him in her direction,
she thought it would not be wise to do so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>MARGERY TAKES THE OARS</h3>
</div>

<p>After dinner Mrs. Archibald prepared herself
for a nap, the most delightful thing she could
think of during the warm hours of such a day.
Margery, after seeing the elder lady comfortably
disposed in the shady sitting-room of the cabin,
went out-of-doors with no doubt in her mind as
to what would be for her the most delightful
thing to do. She would take a row on the lake
all by herself.</p>
<p>She went down to the boat, which was partly
drawn up on the beach and fastened to a heavy
stake. But when she reached it she was disgusted
to find that the chain was secured to the stake by
a padlock. The oars were in the boat, and she
could easily have pushed it into the water, but
she could not set it free without the key to the
padlock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;that the will of
that horrid Mr. Sadler is like gas. It goes everywhere,
even to the tops of the houses and under
the beds.&#8221; But she did not give up her intention.
She tried to detach the chain from the
boat, but finding this impossible, she thought of
going for Martin. Perhaps he might have a key.
This idea, however, she quickly put aside. If he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
had a key, and gave it to her, she might get him
into trouble, and, besides, she did not believe that
he would let her go alone, and in any other way
she did not wish to go. Standing with her pretty
brows knit, and one heel deep in the soft ground
into which she had stamped it, she heard approaching
footsteps, and turning, saw the bishop.
He came forward with a buoyant step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything I can do for you, Miss Dearborn?&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Do you wish to go out on the
lake? Do you want some one to row you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes and no,&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;I want to go
out in the boat, and I don&#8217;t want anybody to row
me. But that chain is fastened with an abominable
padlock, and I cannot launch the boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of your guides is here,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Perhaps
I can get a key from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Margery, quickly; &#8220;he must not
know about it. There is a Sadler law against it,
and he is employed by Sadler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very securely fastened,&#8221; said the bishop,
examining the lock and chain. &#8220;It is the work
of the guide Matlack, I have no doubt. But,
Miss Dearborn,&#8221; said he, with a bright smile,
&#8220;there is a boat at Camp Roy. That is not
locked, and I can bring it here in twenty minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Margery; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want that boat.
I&#8217;ve seen it. It is a clumsy old thing, and, besides,
it leaks. I want this one. This is just the
kind of boat I want to row. It is too bad! If I
could get off now there would be nobody to hinder
me, for Martin is washing the dinner dishes,
or doing something of that kind, and whenever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
he does house-work he always keeps himself out
of sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop examined the stake. It was a stout
little tree trunk driven deep into the ground and
projecting about five feet above the surface, with
the chain so wrapped around it that it was impossible
to force it up or down. Seizing the stake
near the top, the bishop began to push it backward
and forward, and being a man of great
strength, he soon loosened it so much that, stooping,
he was able to pull it from the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; exclaimed Margery. &#8220;It came up
just like pulling a tooth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the radiant bishop, &#8220;the good Matlack
may be very careful about fastening a boat,
but I think I have got the better of him this
time; and now I will put the stake, chain and all,
in the bow. That is the best way of disposing of
them. Are you sure that you prefer going alone?
I shall be delighted to row you if you wish me
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Margery; &#8220;I am just wild to row
myself, and I want to hurry and get off for fear
Martin will be coming down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you understand rowing and the
management of a boat?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I can row; of course I
can. I will get in, and then you can push off the
boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allow me,&#8221; said the bishop. But before he
could reach her to help her, Margery stepped
quickly into the boat and was about to seat herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will take the seat next to the stern,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
said the bishop, holding the boat so that it would
be steady, &#8220;I think that will be better. Then the
weight of the stake in the bow will put the boat
on an even keel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Margery, accepting his suggestion
and seating herself. &#8220;Now just wait
until I get the oars into the rowlocks, and then
you can push me off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way do you intend to row?&#8221; asked the
bishop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall go down towards the lower end of
the lake, because that way there are more bushes
along the banks and Martin will be less apt to see
me. If I go the other way I will be in plain sight
of the camp, and he may think he ought to do
something&mdash;fire a gun across my bows to bring
me to, maybe, as they do at sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;but let me advise
you not to go very far from the shore, so
that if you feel tired you can come in easily,
and if you will allow me I will walk down the
shore in the direction in which you intend to
row.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am not going to get tired,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;I could row all day. It is splendid to be in a
boat all by myself and have the whole management
of it. Now please push me off.&#8221;</p>
<p>With some reluctance, but with a sincere desire
to make the young girl happy, which could not
be overcome by prudence&mdash;at least by such prudence
as he possessed&mdash;the bishop, with a strong,
steady push, sent the boat well out on the surface
of the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was beautifully done,&#8221; Margery called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
back to him. &#8220;Now I have room enough to turn
around without any trouble at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned the boat about with its bow towards
the lower end of the lake, but it was not done
without trouble. &#8220;I have not rowed for a good
while,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I am getting used to the
oars already. Now then, I&#8217;m off,&#8221; and she began
to pull with a strength which, had it been suitably
paired with skill, would have made her an
excellent amateur oarswoman. But the place of
skill was supplied by enthusiasm and determination.
Once or twice an oar slipped from the rowlock
and she nearly went over backward, and
several times one of the blades got under the
water with the flat side up, so that she had difficulty
in getting it out. She raised her oars much
too high in the air, but she counterbalanced this
by sinking them very deep into the water. But
she got on, and although her course was somewhat
irregular, its general trend was in the direction
desired.</p>
<p>The bishop walked along the bank, keeping as
near to the water as he could. Sometimes masses
of shrubbery shut off all view of the lake, and
then there would be an open space where he
would stop and watch the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please keep near the shore, Miss Dearborn,&#8221;
he called, &#8220;that will be better, I think, and it is
certainly more shady and pleasant than farther
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you mean,&#8221; cried Margery, pulling
away in high good-humor, &#8220;you think it is
safer near the shore; but I am not going to row
very far this time, and after a little while I may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
pull the boat in and rest for a time before starting
back,&#8221; and then she rowed on with renewed
energy.</p>
<p>The next time the bishop was able to hail the
boat, it was at a point where he was obliged to
push his way through the bushes in order to see
out upon the lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Dearborn,&#8221; he called, &#8220;I think you are a
great deal too far from shore, and you must be
getting very tired and hot. Your face is greatly
flushed. I will hurry along and see if I can find
a good place for you to stop and cool yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all right,&#8221; cried Margery, resting on her
oars. &#8220;I get along very well, only the boat
doesn&#8217;t steer properly. I think it is because of
the weight of that stick in the bow. I suppose I
cannot get rid of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; cried the bishop, in alarm; &#8220;please
don&#8217;t think of it! But if you touch shore at the
first open space, I think I can arrange it better
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said she; &#8220;you go ahead and find
such a place, and I will come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you touch shore,&#8221; said the bishop to himself,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t go out again in that boat alone!
You don&#8217;t know how to row at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop ran a hundred yards or more before
he found a place at which a boat could be beached.
It was not a very good place, but if he could reach
out and seize the bow, that would be enough
for him. He was strong enough to pull that boat
over a paved street.</p>
<p>As he looked out over the water he saw that
Margery had progressed considerably since he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
had seen her last, but she was still farther from
shore than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Row straight towards me!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Here
is a fine landing-place, cool and shady.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked around and managed to turn the
boat&#8217;s head in his direction. Then she rowed
hard, pulling and splashing, and evidently a little
tired. She was strong, but this unusual exercise
was a trial to her muscles. Perhaps, too, she felt
that the bishop was watching her, and that made
her a little nervous, for she could not help being
aware that she was not handling the oars as well
as when she started out. With a strong pull at
her right oar to turn the boat inland, she got
her left oar tangled between the water and the
boat, so it seemed to her, and lost her hold of it.
In a moment it was overboard and floating on
the lake.</p>
<p>Leaning over the side of the boat, she made a
grasp at the oar, but it was too far for her to
reach it; and then, by a spasmodic movement
of the other oar, the distance was increased.</p>
<p>The bishop&#8217;s face grew pale. As he looked at
her he saw that she was moving away from the
floating oar, and now he understood why she
had progressed so well. There was a considerable
current in the lake which had carried
her along, and was now moving the heavy boat
much faster than it moved the oar. What should
he tell her to do? If she could put her single
oar out at the stern, she might scull the boat;
but he was sure she did not understand sculling,
and to try it she would have to stand up, and this
would be madness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>She now took the other oar from the rowlock,
and was about to rise, when the bishop shouted
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to the stern,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to see if
I cannot reach that oar with this one. Perhaps
I can pull it in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t do that!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand up, or the boat will tip, and you
will fall overboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can I do?&#8221; she called back. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
row with one oar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try rowing a little on one side, and then on
the other,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Perhaps you can bring in
the boat in that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She followed his suggestion, but very awkwardly,
and he saw plainly that she was tired.
Instead of approaching the shore, the boat continued
to float down the lake.</p>
<p>Margery turned again. &#8220;Bishop,&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;what shall I do? I must do something, or I can&#8217;t
get ashore at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not look frightened; there was more of
annoyance in her expression, as if she thought it
impertinent in fate to treat her in this way, and
she would not stand it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had thought of the current,&#8221; said the
bishop to himself, &#8220;I would never have let her go
out alone, and she can&#8217;t be trusted in that boat
another minute longer. She will do something
desperate.&#8221; So saying, the bishop took off his
hat and threw it on the ground. Then he unbuttoned
his coat and began to take it off, but
he suddenly changed his mind. Even in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
wilderness and under these circumstances he
must appear respectable, so he buttoned his
coat again, hastily took off his shoes, and, without
hesitating, walked into the water until it
was above his waist, and then calling to Margery
that he was coming to her, he began to swim out
into the lake. He did not strike out immediately
for the boat, but directed his course towards the
floating oar. Turning his head frequently towards
Margery, he could see that she was sitting perfectly
still, watching him, and so he kept on with
a good heart.</p>
<p>The bishop was a powerful swimmer, but he
found great difficulty in making his way through
the water, on account of the extreme tightness
of his clothes. It seemed to him that his arms
and legs were bandaged in splints, as if he had
been under a surgeon&#8217;s care; but still he struck
out as well as he could, and in time reached the
oar. Pushing this before him to the boat, Margery
took hold of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You swim splendidly,&#8221; said she. &#8220;You can
climb in right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the bishop knew better than that, and
worked his way round to the stern, and after
holding on a little while to get his breath, he
managed to clamber into the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was the water very cold?&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>On his replying that it was, she said she
thought so because he seemed stiff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Dearborn,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have made
the stern seat very wet, but I don&#8217;t believe you
will mind that, and if you will sit here I will take
the oars and row you in.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;BUT THE BISHOP KNEW BETTER&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think I can do that myself,&#8221; said Margery.
&#8220;I am rested now, and I am ever so much
obliged to you for getting my oar for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under almost any circumstances the bishop
could smile, and now he smiled at the ridiculousness
of the idea of Margery&#8217;s rowing that boat
back against the current, and with him in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I must insist. I shall freeze
to death if I don&#8217;t warm myself by exercise.&#8221; So,
reaching out his hand, he assisted Margery to the
stern, and seating himself in her place, he took
the oars, which she had drawn in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why I could not make the boat
go along that way,&#8221; said she, as they began to
move steadily towards the camp. &#8220;I believe I
could do it if people would only let me practise
by myself; but they always want to show me
how, and I hate to have anybody show me how.
It is funny,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;that you seem so
very wet all but your collar. That looks as
smooth and nice as if it had just come from the
laundry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop laughed. &#8220;That is because it is
gutta-percha,&#8221; he said, &#8220;intended for rough
use in camp; but the rest of my habiliments
were not intended for wet weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have no hat,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t
the sun hurt your head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My head does feel a little warm,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but I didn&#8217;t want to row back to the place
where I left my hat. It was not a good landing-place,
after all. Besides,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;I
never thought of my hat or my shoes.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE BISHOP ENGAGES THE ATTENTION OF THE GUIDES</h3>
</div>

<p>When the boat touched the shore Margery ran
to the cabin to assure Mrs. Archibald of her
safety, if she had been missed.</p>
<p>The bishop was sticking the stake in the hole
from which he had pulled it, when Martin came
running to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty piece of business!&#8221; cried the
young man. &#8220;If you wanted to go out in the
boat, why didn&#8217;t you come to me for the key?
You&#8217;ve got no right to pull up the stakes we&#8217;ve
driven down. That&#8217;s the same thing as stealing
the boat. What&#8217;s the matter? Did you tumble
overboard? You must be a pretty sort of an
oarsman! If the ladies want to go out in the
boat, I am here to take them. I&#8217;d like you to
understand that.&#8221;</p>
<p>As has been said before, the bishop could smile
under almost any circumstances, and he smiled
now, but at the same time his brow wrinkled,
which was not common when he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going down to the shore to get my hat
and shoes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I would like you to
come along with me. I can&#8217;t stand here and talk
to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; said Martin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along and see,&#8221; said the bishop; &#8220;that
is, if you are not afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was enough, and the young man walked
behind him until they reached the spot where the
bishop had taken to the water. Then he stopped,
and explained to Martin all that had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what have you got to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin, now that he knew that the bishop had
plunged into the water for the sake of the beautiful
Margery, was more jealously angry than when
he had supposed he had merely taken her out to
row.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything to say,&#8221; he answered,
shortly, &#8220;except that parsons had better attend
to their own business, if they have any, and let
young ladies and boats alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all, is it?&#8221; said the bishop, and with
a quick step forward he clutched the young man&#8217;s
arm with his right hand, while he seized his belt
with the other, and then with a great heave sent
him out into the water fully ten feet from the
shore. With a splash like a dropped anchor
Martin disappeared from view, but soon arose,
his head and shoulders above the surface, where
he stood for a moment, spluttering and winking
and almost dazed.</p>
<p>The bishop stood on the bank and smiled.
&#8220;Did you fall overboard?&#8221; said he. &#8220;You must
be a pretty sort of a boatman!&#8221;</p>
<p>Without replying, Martin began to wade ashore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said the bishop; &#8220;if you can&#8217;t get
up the bank, I&#8217;ll help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Martin needed no help; he scrambled to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
the bank, shook himself, and then advanced upon
the bishop, fire in his eye and his fist clinched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, young man,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;It would
not be fair to you if I did not tell you that I am
a boxer and a heavy-weight, and that I threw you
into the water because I didn&#8217;t want to damage
your face and eyes. You were impertinent, but
I am satisfied, and the best thing you can do is
to go and change your clothes before any one
sees you in that plight. You are better off than
I am, because I have no clothes with which to
make a change.&#8221; So saying, he sat down and began
to put on his shoes.</p>
<p>Martin stood for a moment and looked at the
bishop, he thought of Margery and a possible
black eye, and then he walked as fast as he could
to his tent to get some dry clothes. He was very
wet, he was very hot, he was very angry, and
what made him more angry than anything else
was a respect for the bishop which was rising in
him in spite of all his efforts to keep it down.</p>
<p>When Mr. Archibald and his party came back
to camp late in the afternoon, Margery, who had
already told her story to Mrs. Archibald, told it
to each of the others. Mr. Archibald was greatly
moved by the account of the bishop&#8217;s bravery.
He thoroughly appreciated the danger to which
Margery had been exposed. There were doubtless
persons who could be trusted so sit quietly
in a little boat with only one oar, and to float
upon a lake out of sight and sound of human
beings until another boat could be secured and
brought to the rescue, but Margery was not one
of these persons. Her greatest danger had been
that she was a child of impulse. He went immediately
to Camp Roy to see the bishop and express
his gratitude, for no matter how great the
foolish good-nature of the man had been, his
brave rescue of the girl was all that could be
thought of now.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>He found the bishop in bed, Mr. Clyde preparing
the supper, and Mr. Raybold in a very bad humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best place for me,&#8221; said the bishop,
gayly, from under a heavy army blanket. &#8220;My
bed is something like the carpets in Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s
time, and this shelter-tent is not one which
can be called commodious, but I shall stay here
until morning, and then I am sure I shall be none
the worse for my dip into the cold lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mr. Archibald had seen the black garments
of the bishop hanging on a bush as he approached
the tent, he was not surprised to find their owner
in bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the bishop, when Mr. Archibald
had finished what he had to say, &#8220;there is nothing
to thank me for. It was a stupid thing to
launch a young girl out upon what, by some very
natural bit of carelessness, might have become to
her the waters of eternity, and it was my very
commonplace duty to get her out of the danger
into which I had placed her; so this, my dear
sir, is really all there is to say about the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald differed with him for about ten
minutes, and then returned to his camp.</p>
<p>Phil Matlack was also affected by the account
of the rescue, and he expressed his feelings to
Martin.</p>
<p>&#8220;He pulled up the stake, did he?&#8221; said Phil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll make him pull up his stakes, and before
he goes I&#8217;ve a mind to teach him not to
meddle with other people&#8217;s affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were you,&#8221; said Martin, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t try
to teach him anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think he is too stupid to learn?&#8221; said
Matlack, getting more and more angry at the
bishop&#8217;s impertinent and inexcusable conduct.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve taught stupid people before this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bigger man than you are,&#8221; said Martin.</p>
<p>Matlack withdrew the knife from the loaf of
bread he was cutting, and looked at the young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bigger?&#8221; said he, scornfully. &#8220;What&#8217;s that
got to do with it? A load of hay is bigger than
a crow-bar, but I guess the crow-bar would get
through the hay without much trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better talk about a load of rocks,&#8221; said
Martin. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d find it easy to get
a crow-bar through them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matlack looked up inquiringly. &#8220;Has he been
thrashing you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Martin, sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t fight him, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you? You were here to take
charge of this camp and keep things in order.
Why didn&#8217;t you fight him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fight that sort of a man,&#8221; said Martin,
with an air which, if it were not disdainful, was
intended to be.</p>
<p>Matlack gazed at him a moment in silence, and
then went on cutting the bread. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand
this thing,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I must
look into it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE WORLD GOES WRONG WITH MR. RAYBOLD</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning Mr. Archibald started out,
very early, on a fishing expedition by himself.
He was an enthusiastic angler, and had not greatly
enjoyed the experience of the day before. He
did not object to shooting if there were any legitimate
game to shoot, and he liked to tramp
through the mountain wilds under the guidance
of such a man as Matlack; but to keep company
all day with Raybold, who, in the very heart of
nature, talked only of the gossip of the town, and
who punctuated his small talk by intermittent
firing at everything which looked like a bird or
suggested the movements of an animal, was not
agreeable to him. Clyde was a better fellow, and
Mr. Archibald liked him, but he was young and
abstracted, and the interest which clings around
an abstracted person who is young is often inconsiderable,
so he determined for one day at least
to leave Sir Cupid to his own devices, for he
could not spend all his time defending Margery
from amatory dawdle. For this one day he would
leave the task to his wife.</p>
<p>That day Mr. Raybold was in a moody mood.
Early in the morning he had walked to Sadler&#8217;s,
his object being to secure from the trunk which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
he had left there a suit of ordinary summer
clothes. He had come to think that perhaps his
bicycle attire, although very suitable for this sort
of life, failed to make him as attractive in the
eyes of youth and beauty as he might be if
clothed in more becoming garments. It was the
middle of the afternoon before he returned,
and as he carried a large package, he went directly
to his own camp, and in about half an hour
afterwards he came over to Camp Rob dressed in
a light suit, which improved his general appearance
very much.</p>
<p>In his countenance, however, there was no improvement
whatever, for he looked more out of
humor than when he had set out, and when he
saw that Mrs. Archibald was sitting alone in the
shade, reading, and that at a considerable distance
Harrison Clyde was seated by Margery,
giving her a lesson in drawing upon birch bark,
or else taking a lesson from her, his ill-humor
increased.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad,&#8221; said he, taking a seat by Mrs.
Archibald without being asked; &#8220;everything
seems to go wrong out here in these woods. It
is an unnatural way to live, anyhow, and I suppose
it serves us right. When I went to Sadler&#8217;s
I found a letter from my sister Corona, who says
she would like me to make arrangements for her
to come here and camp with us for a time. Now
that suits me very well indeed. My sister Corona
is a very fine young woman, and I think it would
be an excellent thing to have two young ladies
here instead of one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;that might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
very pleasant. I should be glad for Margery to
have a companion of her own sex.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand precisely,&#8221; said Raybold, nodding
his head sagaciously; &#8220;of her own sex. Yes,
I see your drift, and I agree with you absolutely.
There is a little too much of that thing over there,
and I don&#8217;t wonder you are annoyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not say I was annoyed,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald,
rather surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;you did not say so, but I
can read between the lines, even spoken lines.
Now when I heard that my sister wanted to come
out here,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;at first I did not like it,
for I thought she might be some sort of a restraint
upon me; but when I considered the matter
further, I became very much in favor of it,
and I sent a telegram by the stage telling her to
come immediately, and that everything would be
ready for her. My sister has a sufficient income
of her own, and she likes to have everything
suited to her needs. I am different. I am a man
of the world, and although I do not always care
to conform to circumstances, I can generally
make circumstances conform to me. As Shakespeare
says, &#8216;The world is my pottle, and I stir
my spoon.&#8217; You must excuse my quoting, but I
cannot help it. My life work is to be upon the
stage, and where one&#8217;s mind is, there will his
words be also.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Raybold was now in a much more pleasant
mood than when he came to sit in the shade with
Mrs. Archibald. He was talking; he had found
some one who listened and who had very little to
say for herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Consequently,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I ordered from
Mr. Sadler the very best tent that he had. It has
two compartments in it, and it is really as comfortable
as a house, and as my sister wrote that she
wished a female attendant, not caring to have her
meals cooked by boys&mdash;a very flippant expression,
by-the-way&mdash;I have engaged for her a she-guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221; asked Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;A person,&#8221; said he, &#8220;who is a guide of the female
gender. She was the wife of a hunter who
was accidentally shot, Sadler told me, by a young
man who was with him on a gunning expedition.
I told Sadler that it was reprehensible to allow
such fellows to have guns, but he said that they
are not as dangerous now as they used to be.
This is because the guides have learned to beware
of them, I suppose. This woman has lived in the
woods and knows all about camp life, and Sadler
says there could not be a better person found to
attend a young lady in camp. So I engaged her,
and I must say she charged just as much as if she
were a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t she,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;if
she is just as good?&#8221;</p>
<p>To this remark Raybold paid no attention. &#8220;I
will tell you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;confidentially, of course,
and I think you have as much reason to be interested
in it as I have, why I came to view with
so much favor my sister&#8217;s coming here. She is a
very attractive young woman, and I think she
cannot fail to interest Clyde, and that, of course,
will be of advantage to your niece.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is not my niece, you know,&#8221; said Mrs.
Archibald.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is all the same. &#8216;Let it be
a bird wing or a flower, so it pleases&#8217;&mdash;a quotation
which is also Avonian&mdash;and if Clyde likes Corona
he will let Miss Dearborn alone. That&#8217;s the sort
of man he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in that case,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;I
suppose you would not be unwilling to provide
Margery with company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said the young man, leaning forward
and fixing his eyes upon the ground, and
then turning them upon her without moving his
face towards her, &#8220;with me all that is a different
matter. I may have occasion later to speak to
you and your husband upon the subject of Miss
Dearborn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In which case,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, quickly,
&#8220;I am sure that my husband will be very glad to
speak to you. But why, may I ask, were you so
disturbed when you came here, just now? You
said the world was going wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare,&#8221; said he, knitting his brows and
clapping one hand on his knee, &#8220;I actually forgot!
The world wrong? I should say it was
wrong! My sister can&#8217;t come, and I don&#8217;t know
what to do about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t come?&#8221; asked Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said he, all his ill-humor having
returned. &#8220;That fellow, the bishop, is in our
camp and in Clyde&#8217;s bed. Clyde foolishly gave
him his bed because he said the cook-tent was too
cramped for a man to stay in it all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why need he stay?&#8221; asked Mrs. Archibald.
&#8220;Has he taken cold? Is he sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No indeed,&#8221; said Raybold. &#8220;If he were sick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
we might send for a cart and have him taken to
Sadler&#8217;s, but the trouble is worse than that. His
clothes, in which he foolishly jumped into the
water, have shrunken so much that he cannot get
them on, and as he has no others, he is obliged to
stay in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely something can be done,&#8221; said Mrs.
Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he interrupted, &#8220;nothing can be done.
The clothes have dried, and if you could see them
as they hang up on the bushes, you would understand
why that man can never get into them
again. The material is entirely unsuitable for
out-door life. Clyde proposes that we shall lend
him something, but there are no clothes in this
party into which such a sausage of a man could
get himself. So there he is, and there, I suppose,
he will remain indefinitely; and I don&#8217;t want to
bring my sister to a camp with a permanently
occupied hospital bed in it. As soon as I agreed
to Corona&#8217;s coming I determined to bounce that
man, but now&mdash;&#8221; So saying, Mr. Raybold rose,
folded his arms, and knit his brows, and as he did
so he glanced towards the spot where Margery
and Clyde had been sitting, and perceived that
the latter had departed, probably to get some
more birch bark; and so, with a nod to Mrs.
Archibald, he sauntered away, bending his steps,
as it were accidentally, in the direction of the
young lady left alone.</p>
<p>When Mr. Archibald heard, that evening, of
the bishop&#8217;s plight and Raybold&#8217;s discomfiture, he
was amused, but also glad to know there was an
opportunity for doing something practical for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
bishop. He was beginning to like the man, in
spite of his indefiniteness, so he went to see the
bedridden prelate who was neither sick nor clerical,
and with very little trouble induced him to
take a few general measurements of his figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so good of you,&#8221; said the delighted recumbent,
&#8220;that I shall not say a word, but step
aside in deference to your conscience, whose encomiums
will far transcend anything I can say.
You will pardon me, I am sure, if I make my
measurements liberal. The cost will not be increased,
and to live, move, and breathe in a suit
of clothes which is large enough for me is a joy
which I have not known for a long time. Shoes,
did you say, sir? Truly this is generosity supereminent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, laughing, &#8220;and you
also shall have a new hat. I will fit you out completely,
and if this helps you to make a new and
a good start in life, I shall be greatly gratified.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the bishop, the moisture of genuine
gratitude in his eyes, &#8220;you are doing, I think, far
more good than you can imagine, and pardon me
if I suggest, since you are going to get me a hat,
that it be not of clerical fashion. If everything
is to be new, I should like everything different,
and I am certain the cost will be less.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald. &#8220;I will now
make a list of what you need, and I will write to
one of my clerks, who will procure everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mr. Archibald went back to his camp he
met Raybold, stalking moodily. Having been
told what had been done for the bishop&#8217;s relief,
the young man was astonished.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A complete outfit, and for him? I would not
have dreamed of it; and besides, it is of no use;
it must be days before the clothes arrive, and my
sister wishes to come immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Archibald,
&#8220;that I am doing this for the sake of your sister?
I am doing it for the man himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mr. Archibald told his wife of this little
interview they both laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mr. Raybold&#8217;s sister,&#8221; said she, &#8220;is like
him, I do not think we shall care to have her
here; but sisters are often very different from
their brothers. However, the bishop need not
prevent her coming. If his clothes do not arrive
before she does, I am sure there could be no objection
to her tent being set up for a time in some
of the open space in our camp, and then we shall
become sooner acquainted with her; if she is
a suitable person, I shall be very glad indeed for
Margery to have a companion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald; &#8220;let her pitch
her tent where she pleases. I am satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE ASSERTION OF INDIVIDUALITY</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a week after her brother had sent her
his telegram before Miss Corona Raybold arrived
at Camp Rob, with her tent, her outfit, and her
female guide. Mrs. Archibald had been surprised
that she did not appear sooner, for, considering
Mr. Raybold&#8217;s state of mind, she had supposed
that his sister had wished to come at the earliest
possible moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Raybold, in explaining the delay,
&#8220;Corona is very different from me. In my actions
&#8216;the thunder&#8217;s roar doth crowd upon the
lightning&#8217;s heels,&#8217; as William has told us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where in Shakespeare is that?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Archibald.</p>
<p>Mr. Raybold bent his brow. &#8220;For the nonce,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I do not recall the exact position of the
lines.&#8221; And after that he made no more Avonian
quotations to Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>The arrival of the young lady was, of course, a
very important event, and even Mr. Archibald
rowed in from the lake when he saw her caravan
approaching, herself walking in the lead. She
proved to be a young person of medium height,
slight, and dressed in a becoming suit of dark
blue. Her hair and eyes were dark, her features
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
regular and of a classic cut, and she wore eye-glasses.
Her manner was quiet, and at first she
appeared reserved, but she soon showed that if
she wished to speak she could talk very freely.
She wore an air of dignified composure, but was
affable, and very attentive to what was said to
her.</p>
<p>Altogether she made in a short time an extremely
favorable impression upon Mr. and Mrs. Archibald,
and in a very much less time an extremely
unfavorable impression upon Margery.</p>
<p>Miss Raybold greeted everybody pleasantly,
even informing Matlack that she had heard of
him as a famous guide, and after thanking Mr.
and Mrs. Archibald for their permission to set up
her tent on the outskirts of their camp, she proceeded
to said tent, which was speedily made
ready for her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkenpine, her guide, was an energetic
woman, and under her orders the men who brought
the baggage bestirred themselves wonderfully.</p>
<p>Just before supper, to which meal the Raybolds
and Mr. Clyde had been invited, the latter came
to Mr. Archibald, evidently much troubled and
annoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am positively ashamed to mention it to you,
sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I must tell you that Raybold
has ordered the men who brought his sister&#8217;s tent
to bring our tent over here and put it up near
her&#8217;s. I was away when this was done, and I wish
to assure you most earnestly that I had nothing
to do with it. The men have gone, and I don&#8217;t
suppose we can get it back to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald opened his eyes very wide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
&#8220;Your friend is certainly a remarkable young
man,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but we must not have any bad
feeling in camp, so let everything remain as it is
for to-night. I suppose he wished to be near his
sister, but at least he might have asked permission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Clyde, &#8220;that he did not so much
care to be near his sister as he did to be away
from the bishop, who is now left alone in our
little shelter-tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;he
will come to no harm, and we must see that he
has some supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall attend to that,&#8221; said Clyde, &#8220;and
to his breakfast also. And, now I come to think
of it, I believe that one reason Raybold moved
our tent over here was to get the benefit of his
sister&#8217;s cook. The bishop did our cooking, you
know, before he took to his bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evening Miss Raybold joined the party
around the camp-fire. She declared that in the
open air she did not in the least object to the use
of tobacco, and then she asked Mr. Archibald if
his two guides came to the camp-fire after their
work was done.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do just as they please,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;Sometimes they come over here and smoke their
pipes a little in the background, and sometimes
they go off by themselves. We are very democratic
here in camp, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like that,&#8221; said Miss Raybold, &#8220;and I will
have Mrs. Perkenpine come over when she has
arranged the tent for the night. Arthur, will
you go and tell her?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>Her brother did not immediately rise to execute
this commission. He hoped that Mr. Clyde
would offer to do the service, but the latter did
not improve the opportunity to make himself
agreeable to the new-comer, and Raybold did the
errand.</p>
<p>Harrison Clyde was sitting by Margery, and
Margery was giving a little attention to what he
said to her and a great deal of attention to Corona
Raybold.</p>
<p>&#8220;More self-conceit and a better-fitting dress I
never saw,&#8221; thought Margery; &#8220;it&#8217;s loose and
easy, and yet it seems to fit perfectly, and I do
believe she thinks she is some sort of an upper
angel who has condescended to come down here
just to see what common people are like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corona talked to Mr. Archibald. It was her
custom always to talk to the principal personage
of a party.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives me pleasure, sir,&#8221; said she, &#8220;to meet
with you and your wife. It is so seldom that we
find any one&mdash;&#8221; She was interrupted by Mrs.
Perkenpine, who stood behind her.</p>
<p>The she-guide was a large woman, apparently
taller than Matlack. Her sunburnt face was
partly shaded by a man&#8217;s straw hat, secured on
her head by strings tied under her chin. She
wore a very plain gown, coarse in texture, and
of a light-blue color, which showed that it had
been washed very often. Her voice and her
shoes, the latter well displayed by her short
skirt, creaked, but her gray eyes were bright,
and moved about after the manner of searchlights.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said she to Miss Raybold, &#8220;what do
you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>Corona turned her head and placidly gazed up
at her. &#8220;I simply wished to let you know that
you might join this company here if you liked.
The two men guides are coming, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkenpine glanced around the group.
&#8220;Is there any hunting stories to be told?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald laughed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but perhaps we may have some. I am sure
that Matlack here has hunting stories to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkenpine shook her head. &#8220;No, sir,&#8221;
said she; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want none of his stories. I&#8217;ve
heard them all mostly two or three times over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say you have,&#8221; said Phil, seating himself
on a fallen trunk, a little back from the fire;
&#8220;but you see, Mrs. Perkenpine, you are so obstinate
about keepin&#8217; on livin&#8217;. If you&#8217;d died when
you was younger, you wouldn&#8217;t have heard so
many of those stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been times,&#8221; said she, &#8220;when you was
tellin&#8217; the story of the bear cubs and the condensed
milk, when I wished I had died when I was
younger, or else you had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Miss Raybold, in a clear, decisive
voice, &#8220;Mr. Matlack may know hunting
stories that will be new to all of us, but before
he begins them I have something which I would
like to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mrs. Perkenpine, seating herself
promptly upon the ground; &#8220;if you&#8217;re goin&#8217;
to talk, I&#8217;ll stay. I&#8217;d like to know what kind of
things you do talk about when you talk.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was just now remarking,&#8221; said Miss Corona,
&#8220;that I am very glad indeed to meet with those
who, like Mr. and Mrs. Archibald, are willing to
set their feet upon the modern usages of society
(which would crowd us together in a common
herd) and assert their individuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald looked at the speaker inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I refer to the fact that
you and Mrs. Archibald are on a wedding-journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this remark Phil Matlack rose suddenly
from the tree-trunk and Martin dropped his pipe.
Mr. Clyde turned his gaze upon Margery, who
thereupon burst out laughing, and then he looked
in amazement from Mr. Archibald to Mrs. Archibald
and back again. Mrs. Perkenpine sat up
very straight and leaned forward, her hands upon
her knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it them two sittin&#8217; over there?&#8221; she said,
pointing to Margery and Clyde. &#8220;Are they on a
honey-moon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; exclaimed Arthur Raybold, in a loud,
sharp voice. &#8220;What an absurdity! Corona, what
are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>To this his sister paid no attention whatever.
&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it was a noble thing to do.
An assertion of one&#8217;s inner self is always noble,
and when I heard of this assertion I wished very
much to know the man and the woman who had
so asserted themselves, and this was my principal
reason for determining to come to this camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where on earth,&#8221; asked Mr. Archibald,
&#8220;did you hear that we were on a wedding-journey?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I read it in a newspaper,&#8221; said Corona.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do declare,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Archibald,
&#8220;everything is in the newspapers! I did think
that we might settle down here and enjoy ourselves
without people talking about our reason
for coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say,&#8221; cried Mrs. Perkenpine,
now on her feet, &#8220;that you two elderly
ones is the honey-mooners?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, looking with amusement
on the astonished faces about him, &#8220;we
truly are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the she-guide, seating herself, &#8220;if
I&#8217;d stayed an old maid as long as that, I think I&#8217;d
stuck it out. But perhaps you was a widow,
mum?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; cried Mr. Archibald; &#8220;she was
a charming girl when I married her. But just
let me tell you how the matter stands,&#8221; and he
proceeded to relate the facts of the case. &#8220;I
thought,&#8221; he said, in conclusion, turning to Matlack,
&#8220;that perhaps you knew about it, for I told
Mr. Sadler, and I supposed he might have mentioned
it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Matlack, relighting his pipe,
&#8220;he knows me better than that. If he&#8217;d called
me and said, &#8216;Phil, I want you to take charge of
a couple that&#8217;s goin&#8217; honey-moonin&#8217; about twenty-five
years after they married, and a-doin&#8217; it for
somebody else and not for themselves,&#8217; I&#8217;d said to
him, &#8216;They&#8217;re lunatics, and I won&#8217;t take charge
of them.&#8217; And Peter he knows I would have
thought that and would have said it, and so he
did not mention the particulars to me. He knows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
that the only things that I&#8217;m afraid of in this
world is lunatics. &#8216;Tisn&#8217;t only what they might
do to me, but what they might do to themselves,
and I won&#8217;t touch &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;that you don&#8217;t
consider us lunatics now that you have heard
why we are here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said the guide; &#8220;I&#8217;ve found that
you&#8217;re regular common-sense people, and I don&#8217;t
change my opinions even when I&#8217;ve heard particulars;
but if I&#8217;d heard particulars first, it would
have been all up with my takin&#8217; charge of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you knew it all the time?&#8221; said Clyde to
Margery, speaking so that she only could hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t think it
worth talking about. Do you know Mr. Raybold&#8217;s
sister? Do you like her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have met her,&#8221; said Clyde; &#8220;but she is too
lofty for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is there lofty about her?&#8221; said Margery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;she is lofty because she has
elevated ideas. She goes in for reform; and for
pretty much all kinds, from what I have heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she is lofty,&#8221; remarked Margery,
&#8220;because she is stuck-up. I don&#8217;t like her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so seldom,&#8221; Corona now continued, &#8220;that
we find people who are willing to assert their individuality,
and when they are found I always
want to talk to them. I suppose, Mr. Matlack,
that your life is one long assertion of individuality?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; asked the guide.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that when you are out
alone in the wild forest, holding in your hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the weapon which decides the question of life or
death for any living creature over whom you may
choose to exercise your jurisdiction, absolutely
independent of every social trammel, every bond
of conventionalism, you must feel that you are
a predominant whole and not a mere integral
part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Matlack, speaking slowly, &#8220;I may
have had them feelin&#8217;s, but if I did they must
have struck in, and not come out on the skin, like
measles, where I could see &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Corona,&#8221; said her brother, in a peevish undertone,
&#8220;what is the good of all that? You&#8217;re wasting
your words on such a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>His sister turned a mild steady gaze upon him.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any man but you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;on
whom I waste my words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is assertin&#8217; like persistin&#8217;?&#8221; inquired Mrs.
Perkenpine at this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two actions are somewhat alike,&#8221; said
Corona.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said the she-guide, &#8220;I&#8217;m in for
assertin&#8217;. When my husband was alive there was
a good many things I wanted to do, and when I
wanted to do a thing or get a thing I kept on
sayin&#8217; so; and one day, after I&#8217;d been keepin&#8217; on
sayin&#8217; so a good while, he says to me, &#8216;Jane,&#8217; says
he, &#8216;it seems to me that you&#8217;re persistin&#8217;.&#8217; &#8216;Yes,&#8217;
says I, &#8216;I am, and I intend to be.&#8217; &#8216;Then you
are goin&#8217; to keep on insistin&#8217; on persistin&#8217;?&#8217; says
he. &#8216;Yes,&#8217; says I; and then says he, &#8216;If you keep
on insistin&#8217; on persistin&#8217; I&#8217;ll be thinkin&#8217; of &#8217;listin&#8217;.&#8217;
By which he meant goin&#8217; into the army as a regular,
and gettin&#8217; rid of me; and as I didn&#8217;t want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
to be rid of him, I stopped persistin&#8217;; but now I
wish I had persisted, for then he&#8217;d &#8217;listed, and
most likely would be alive now, through not
bein&#8217; shot in the back by a city fool with a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald to her
husband, when they had retired to their cabin,
&#8220;that that young woman is going to be much of
a companion for Margery. I think she will prefer
your society to that of any of the rest of us.
It is very plain that she thinks it is your individuality
which has been asserted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, rubbing his spectacles with his
handkerchief before putting them away for the
night, &#8220;don&#8217;t let her project her individuality into
my sport. That&#8217;s all I have to say.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A NET OF COBWEBS TO CAGE A LION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s something besides a lunatic
that you are afraid of,&#8221; said Martin to Matlack
the next morning, as they were preparing breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired the guide, sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that fellow they call the bishop,&#8221; said
Martin. &#8220;He put a pretty heavy slur on you.
You drove down a stake, and you locked your
boat to it, and you walked away as big as if you
were the sheriff of the county, and here he comes
along, and snaps his fingers at you and your
locks, and, as cool as a cucumber, he pulls up the
stake and shoves out on the lake, all alone by
herself, a young lady that you are paid to take
care of and protect from danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to know, Martin Sanders,&#8221; said
Matlack, &#8220;that I don&#8217;t pitch into a man when he&#8217;s
in his bed, no matter what it is that made him
take to his bed or stay there. But I&#8217;ll just say to
you now, that when he gets up and shows himself,
there&#8217;ll be the biggest case of bounce in
these parts that you ever saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bounce!&#8221; said Martin to himself, as he turned
away. &#8220;I have heard so much of it lately that
I&#8217;d like to see a little.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>Matlack also communed with himself. &#8220;He&#8217;s
awful anxious to get up a quarrel between me
and the parson,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I wonder if he
was too free with his tongue and did get thrashed.
He don&#8217;t show no signs of it, except he&#8217;s so concerned
in his mind to see somebody do for the
parson what he ain&#8217;t able to do himself. But I&#8217;ll
find out about it! I&#8217;ll thrash that fellow in
black, and before I let him up I&#8217;ll make him tell
me what he did to Martin. I&#8217;d do a good deal
to get hold of something that would take the
conceit out of that fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Raybold was a deep-minded person,
and sometimes it was difficult for him, with the
fathoming apparatus he had on hand, to discover
the very bottom of his mind. Now, far below
the surface, his thoughts revolved. He had come
to the conclusion that he would marry Margery.
In the first place, he was greatly attracted by
her, and again he considered it would be a most
advantageous union. She was charming to look
upon, and her mind was so uncramped by conventionalities
that it could adapt itself to almost
any sphere to which she might direct it. He expected
his life-work to be upon the stage, and
what an actress Miss Dearborn would make if
properly educated&mdash;as he could educate her!
With this most important purpose in view, why
should he waste his time? The Archibalds could
not much longer remain in camp. They had
limited their holiday to a month, and that was
more than half gone. He must strike now.</p>
<p>The first thing to do was to get Clyde out of
the way; then he would speak to Mr. Archibald
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
and ask for authority to press his suit, and he
would press that suit as few men on earth, he
said to himself, would be able to press it. What
girl could deny herself to him when he came
to her clad not only with his own personal attributes,
but with the fervor of a Romeo, the intellectuality
of a Hamlet, and the force of an
Othello?</p>
<p>The Clyde part of the affair seemed very simple;
as his party would of course have their own
table Clyde would see his sister at every meal,
and as Corona did not care to talk to him, and
must talk to somebody, she would be compelled
to talk to Clyde, and if she talked to Clyde and
looked at him as she always did when she talked
to people, he did not see how he could help being
attracted by her, and when once that sort of
thing began the Margery-field would be open to
him.</p>
<p>He excused himself that morning for hurriedly
leaving the breakfast-table by saying that he
wished to see Mr. Archibald before he started
out fishing.</p>
<p>He found that gentleman talking to Matlack.
&#8220;Can I see you alone, sir?&#8221; said Raybold. &#8220;I
have something of importance I wish to say to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;for I have something
I wish to say to you,&#8221; and they retired towards
the lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; inquired Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is this,&#8221; said Raybold, folding his arms as
he spoke. &#8220;I am a man of but few words. When
I have formed a purpose I call upon my actions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
to express it rather than my speech. I will not
delay, therefore, to say to you that I love your
ward, and my sole object in seeking this interview
is to ask your permission to pay my addresses
to her. That permission given, I will attend
to the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After you have dropped your penny in the
slot,&#8221; remarked Mr. Archibald. &#8220;I must say,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;that I am rather surprised at the
nature of your communication. I supposed you
were going to explain your somewhat remarkable
conduct in bringing your tent into my camp without
asking my permission or even speaking to me
about it; but as what you have said is of so much
more importance than that breach of good manners
I will let the latter drop. But why did
you ask my permission to address Miss Dearborn?
Why didn&#8217;t you go and do it just as you brought
your tent here? Did you think that if you had
a permit from me for that sort of sport you could
warn off trespassers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was something of that kind,&#8221; said Raybold,
&#8220;although I should not have put it in that trifling
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will remark,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;that
I know nothing of your matrimonial availability,
and I do not want to know anything about it.
My wife and I brought Miss Dearborn here to
enjoy herself in the woods, not to be sought in
marriage by strangers. For the present I am
her guardian, and as such I say to you that I forbid
you to make her a proposal of marriage, or,
indeed, to pay her any attentions which she may
consider serious. If I see that you do not respect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
my wishes in this regard, I shall ask you to consider
our acquaintance at an end, and shall dispense
with your visits to this camp. Have I
spoken plainly?&#8221;</p>
<p>The knitted brows of Raybold were directed
towards the ground. &#8220;You have spoken plainly,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and I have heard,&#8221; and with a bow he
walked away.</p>
<p>As he approached his tent a smile, intended to
be bitter, played about his features.</p>
<p>&#8220;A net of cobwebs,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;to cage a
lion!&#8221;</p>
<p>The weather had now grown sultry, the afternoon
was very hot, and there was a general desire
to lie in the shade and doze. Margery&#8217;s
plans for a siesta were a little more complicated
than those of the others. She longed to lie in a
hammock under great trees, surrounded by the
leafy screens of the woodlands; to gaze at the
blue sky through the loop-holes in the towering
branches above her, and to dream of the mysteries
of the forest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; said she, to the young guide, &#8220;is
there a hammock among the things we brought
with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>His face brightened. &#8220;Of course there are
hammocks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wonder none of you
asked about them before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of it,&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
had time for lounging, and as for Aunt Harriet,
she would not get into one for five dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where shall I hang it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not anywhere about here. Couldn&#8217;t you find
some nice place in the woods, not far away, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
where I would not be seen, and might have a little
time to myself? If you can, come and tell me
quietly where it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what she means,&#8221; said Martin to himself.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame that she should be annoyed.
I can find you just such a place,&#8221; he said to Margery.
&#8220;I will hang the hammock there, and I
will take care that nobody else shall know where
it is.&#8221; And away he went, bounding heart and
foot.</p>
<p>In less than a quarter of an hour he returned.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all ready, Miss Dearborn,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think
I have found a place you will like. It&#8217;s generally
very close in the woods on a day like this, but
there is a little bluff back of us, and at the end
of it the woods are open, so that there is a good
deal of air there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is charming,&#8221; said Margery, and with a
book in her hand she accompanied Martin.</p>
<p>They were each so interested in the hammock
business that they walked side by side, instead of
one following the other, as had been their custom
heretofore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this is a delightful place!&#8221; cried Margery.
&#8220;I can lie here and look down into the very heart
of the woods; it is a solitude like Robinson Crusoe&#8217;s
island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you like it,&#8221; said Martin. &#8220;I thought
you would. I have put up the hammock strongly,
so that you need not be afraid of it; but if there
is any other way you want it I can change it.
There is not a thing here that can hurt you, and
if a little snake should happen along it would be
glad to get away from you if you give it a chance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
But if you should be frightened or should want
anything you have only to call for me. I shall
hear you, for I shall be out in the open just at
the edge of the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said Margery; &#8220;nothing
could be nicer than this, and you did it so
quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled with pleasure as he answered that he
could have done it more quickly if it had been
necessary; and then he retired slowly, that she
might call him back if she thought of anything
she wanted.</p>
<p>Margery lay in the hammock, gazing out over
the edge of the bluff into the heart of the woods;
her closed book was in her hand, and the gentle
breeze that shook the leaves around her and disturbed
the loose curls about her face was laden
with a moist spiciness which made her believe it
had been wandering through some fragrant foliage
of a kind unknown to her, far away in the
depths of the forest, where she could not walk
on account of the rocks, the great bushes, and
the tall ferns. It was lovely to lie and watch
the leafy boughs, which seemed as if they were
waving their handkerchiefs to the breeze as it
passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe,&#8221; she said to herself, as she cast
her eyes upward towards an open space above
her, &#8220;that if I were that little white cloud and
could float over the whole world and drop down
on any spot I chose that I could drop into a
lovelier place than this.&#8221; Then she brought
her gaze again to earth, and her mind went
out between the shadowy trunks which stretched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
away and away and away towards the mysteries
of the forest, which must always be mysteries
to her because it was impossible for her to get
to them and solve them&mdash;that is, if she remained
awake. But if Master Morpheus should happen
by, she might yet know everything&mdash;for there
are no mysteries which cannot be solved in
dreams.</p>
<p>Master Morpheus came, but with him came
also Arthur Raybold; not by the little pathway
that approached from the direction of the
lake, but parting the bushes as if he had been
exploring. When she heard footsteps behind
her, Margery looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Raybold!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;How on earth
did you happen here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not happen,&#8221; said he, wiping his brow
with his handkerchief. &#8220;I have been looking for
you, and I have had tough work of it. I saw you
go into the woods, and I went in also, although
some distance below here, and I have had a hard
and tiresome job working my way up to you;
but I have found you. I knew I should, for I
had bent my mind to the undertaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wish you hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Margery, in a
vexed tone. &#8220;I came here to be alone and take
a nap, and I wish you would find some other nice
place and go and take a nap yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled deeply. &#8220;That would not answer
my purpose at all,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Napping is far
from my desires.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t care anything about your desires,&#8221;
said Margery, in a tone which showed she was
truly vexed, &#8220;I have pre-empted this place, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
I want it to myself. I was just falling into a
most delightful doze when you came, and I don&#8217;t
think you have any right to come here and disturb
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sense of right, Miss Dearborn,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;comes from the heart, and we do not have to
ask other people what it is. My heart has given
me the right to come here, and here I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what in the name of common-sense are
you here for?&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;Speaking about
your heart makes me think you came here to
make love to me. Is that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I wish you to hear me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Raybold,&#8221; said she, her eyes as bright, he
thought, as if they had belonged to his sister
when she was urging some of her favorite views
upon a company, &#8220;I won&#8217;t listen to one word of
such stuff. This is no place for love-making, and
I won&#8217;t have it. If you want to make love to
me you can wait until I go home, and then you
can come and speak to my mother about it, and
when you have spoken to her you can speak to
me, but I won&#8217;t listen to it here. Not one
word!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus did the indignant craftiness of Margery
express itself. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good deal better,&#8221; she
thought, &#8220;than telling him no, and having him
keep on begging and begging.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Dearborn,&#8221; said Raybold, &#8220;what I have
to say cannot be postponed. The words within
me must be spoken, and I came here to speak
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sudden supple twist Margery turned
herself, hammock and all, and stood on her feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
on the ground. &#8220;Martin!&#8221; she cried, at the top
of her voice.</p>
<p>Raybold stepped back astonished. &#8220;What is
this?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Am I to understand&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he had time to complete his sentence
Martin Sanders sprang into the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he exclaimed, with a glare at
Raybold, as if he suspected why he had been
called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; said Margery, with a good deal of
sharpness in her voice, &#8220;I want you to take down
this hammock and carry it away. I can&#8217;t stay
here any longer. I thought that at least one
quiet place out-of-doors could be found where I
would not be disturbed, but it seems there is no
such place. Perhaps you can hang the hammock
somewhere near our cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin&#8217;s face grew very red. &#8220;I think,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;that you ought not to be obliged to go away
because you have been disturbed. Whoever disturbed
you should go away, and not you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Mr. Raybold&#8217;s face also grew red. &#8220;There
has been enough of this!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Guide,
you can go where you came from. You are not
wanted here. If Miss Dearborn wishes her hammock
taken down, I will do it.&#8221; Then turning
to Margery, he continued: &#8220;You do not know
what it is I have to say to you. If you do not
hear me now, you will regret it all your life.
Send this man away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would very much like to send a man away
if I knew how to do it,&#8221; said Margery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do it?&#8221; cried Martin. &#8220;Oh, Miss Dearborn,
if you want it done, ask me to do it for you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; shouted Raybold, making two steps
towards the young guide; then he stopped, for
Margery stood in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen two men fight,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t say I wouldn&#8217;t like it, just once;
but you would have to have on boxing-gloves; I
couldn&#8217;t stand a fight with plain hands, so you
needn&#8217;t think of it. Martin, take down the hammock
just as quickly as you can. And if you
want to stay here, Mr. Raybold, you can stay,
but if you want to talk, you can talk to the
trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin heaved a sigh of disappointment, and
proceeded to unfasten the hammock from the
trees to which it had been tied. For a moment
Raybold looked as if he were about to interfere,
but there was something in the feverish agility
of the young guide which made his close proximity
as undesirable as that of a package of dynamite.</p>
<p>Margery turned to leave the place, but suddenly
stopped. She would wait until Martin was ready
to go with her. She would not leave those two
young men alone.</p>
<p>Raybold was very angry. He knew well that
such a chance for a private interview was not
likely to occur again, and he would not give up.
He approached the young girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; she cried to the guide, who was now
ready to go, &#8220;put down that hammock and come
here. Now, sir,&#8221; she said, turning to Raybold,
&#8220;let me hear you call me Margery again!&#8221;</p>
<p>She waited for about a half a minute, but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
was not called by name. Then she and Martin
went away. She had nearly reached the cabin
before she spoke, and then she turned to the
young man and said: &#8220;Martin, you needn&#8217;t
trouble yourself about putting up that hammock
now; I don&#8217;t want to lie in it. I&#8217;m going into
the house. I am very much obliged to you for
the way you stood by me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stood by you!&#8221; he exclaimed, in a low voice,
which seemed struggling in the grasp of something
which might or might not be stronger than
itself. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know how glad I am to stand
by you, and how I would always&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Margery; &#8220;thank you very
much,&#8221; and she walked away towards the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; she sighed, as she opened the door
and went in.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A MAN WHO FEELS HIMSELF A MAN</h3>
</div>

<p>Towards the end of the afternoon, when the
air had grown cooler, Mr. Archibald proposed a
boating expedition to the lower end of the lake.
His boat was large enough for Matlack, the
three ladies, and himself, and if the two young
men wished to follow, they had a boat of their
own.</p>
<p>When first asked to join the boating party Miss
Corona Raybold hesitated; she did not care very
much about boating; but when she found that if
she stayed in camp she would have no one to
talk to, she accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald took the oars nearest the stern,
while Matlack seated himself forward, and this
arrangement suited Miss Corona exactly.</p>
<p>The boat kept down the middle of the lake,
greatly aided by the current, and Corona talked
steadily to Mr. Archibald. Mrs. Archibald, who
always wanted to do what was right, and who
did not like to be left out of any conversation
on important subjects, made now and then a remark,
and whenever she spoke Corona turned
to her and listened with the kindest attention,
but the moment the elder lady had finished, the
other resumed her own thread of observation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
without the slightest allusion to what she had
just heard.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Archibald, he seldom said a word.
He listened, sometimes his eyes twinkled, and he
pulled easily and steadily. Doubtless he had a
good many ideas, but none of them was expressed.
As for Margery, she leaned back in the stern, and
thought that, after all, she liked Miss Raybold
better than she did her brother, for the young
lady did not speak one word to her, nor did she
appear to regard her in any way.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how on earth,&#8221; thought Margery, &#8220;she
can float over this beautiful water and under this
lovely sky, with the grandeur of the forest all
about her, and yet pay not the slightest attention
to anything she sees, but keep steadily talking
about her own affairs and the society she belongs
to, I cannot imagine. She might as well
live in a cellar and have pamphlets and reformers
shoved down to her through the coal-hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Messrs. Clyde and Raybold accompanied the
larger boat in their own skiff. It was an unwieldy
craft, with but one pair of oars, and as
the two young men were not accustomed to rowing
together, and as Mr. Raybold was not accustomed
to rowing at all and did not like it, Mr.
Clyde pulled the boat. But, do what he could, it
was impossible for him to get near the other boat.
Matlack, who was not obliged to listen to Miss
Corona, kept his eye upon the following skiff, and
seemed to fear a collision if the two boats came
close together, for if Clyde pulled hard he pulled
harder. Arthur Raybold was not satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were a better oarsman,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
said to the other; &#8220;but now I suppose we shall
not come near them until we land.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Archibald party did not land. Under
the guidance of Matlack they swept slowly
around the lower end of the lake; they looked
over the big untenanted camp-ground there;
they stopped for a moment to gaze into the rift
in the forest through which ran the stream which
connected this lake with another beyond it, and
then they rowed homeward, keeping close to the
farther shore, so as to avoid the strength of the
current.</p>
<p>Clyde, who had not reached the end of the lake,
now turned and determined to follow the tactics
of the other boat and keep close to the shore, but
on the side nearest to the camp. This exasperated
Raybold.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do?&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
you keep in the middle we may get near them,
and why should we be on one side of the lake and
they on the other?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get back as soon as they do,&#8221; said
Clyde, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t want to pull against the
current.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; said Raybold. &#8220;If you are tired, let
me have the oars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrison Clyde looked for a minute at his companion,
and then deliberately changed the course
of the boat and rowed straight towards the shore,
paying no attention whatever to the excited remonstrances
of Raybold. He beached the boat at
a rather poor landing-place among some bushes,
and then, jumping out, he made her fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; cried Raybold, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
scrambled on shore. &#8220;Is she leaking more than
she did? What is the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is not leaking more than usual,&#8221; said the
other, &#8220;but I am not going to pull against that
current with you growling in the stern. I am
going to walk back to camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>In consequence of this resolution the two young
men reached Camp Rob about the same time
that the Archibald boat touched shore, and at
least an hour before they would have arrived had
they remained in their boat.</p>
<p>The party was met by Mrs. Perkenpine, bearing
letters and newspapers. A man had arrived from
Sadler&#8217;s in their absence, and he had brought the
mail. Nearly every one had letters; there was
even something for Martin. Standing where they
had landed, seated on bits of rock, on the grass,
or on camp-chairs, all read their letters.</p>
<p>While thus engaged a gentleman approached
the party from the direction of Camp Roy. He
was tall, well built, handsomely dressed in a suit
of light-brown tweed, and carried himself with a
buoyant uprightness. A neat straw hat with a
broad ribbon shaded his smooth-shaven face,
which sparkled with cordial good-humor. A blue
cravat was tied tastefully under a broad white
collar, and in his hand he carried a hickory
walking-stick, cut in the woods, but good enough
for a city sidewalk. Margery was the first to raise
her eyes at the sound of the quickly approaching
footsteps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness gracious!&#8221; she exclaimed, and then
everybody looked up.</p>
<p>For a moment the new-comer was gazed upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
in silence. From what gigantic bandbox could
this well-dressed stranger have dropped? Then,
with a loud laugh, Mr. Archibald cried, &#8220;The
bishop!&#8221;</p>
<p>No wonder there had not been instant recognition.
The loose, easy-fitting clothes gave no
hint of redundant plumpness; no soiled shovel-hat
cast a shadow over the smiling face, and a
glittering shirt front banished all thought of
gutta-percha.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; exclaimed the bishop, raising his
hat and stepping quickly towards Mrs. Archibald,
&#8220;I cannot express the pleasure I feel in meeting
you again. And as for you, sir,&#8221; holding out his
hand to Mr. Archibald, &#8220;I have no words in which
to convey my feelings. Look upon a man, sir, who
feels himself a man, and then remember from
what you raised him. I can say no more now,
but I can never forget what you have done,&#8221; and
as he spoke he pressed Mr. Archibald&#8217;s hand
with an honest fervor, which distorted for a moment
the features of that gentleman.</p>
<p>From one to the other of the party the bishop
glanced, as he said, &#8220;How glad, how unutterably
glad, I am to be again among you!&#8221; Turning
his eyes towards Miss Raybold, he stopped. That
young lady had put down the letter she was reading,
and was gazing at him through her spectacles
with calm intensity. &#8220;This lady,&#8221; said the bishop,
turning towards Raybold, &#8220;is your sister, I presume?
May I have the honor?&#8221;</p>
<p>Raybold looked at him without speaking. Here
was an example of the silly absurdity of throwing
pearls before swine. He had never wanted to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
have anything to do with the fellow when he was
in the gutter, and he wanted nothing to do with
him now.</p>
<p>With a little flush on her face Mrs. Archibald
rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Raybold,&#8221; she said, &#8220;let me present to
you&#8221;&mdash;and she hesitated for a moment&mdash;&#8220;the
gentleman we call the bishop. I think you have
heard us speak of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Raybold, rising, with a
charming smile on her handsome face, and extending
her hand, &#8220;I have heard of him, and I
am very glad to meet him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have also heard of you,&#8221; said the bishop, as
he stood smiling beside Corona&#8217;s camp-chair,
&#8220;and I have regretted that I have been the innocent
means of preventing you for a time from
occupying your brother&#8217;s camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do not mention that,&#8221; said Corona, sweetly.
&#8220;I walked over there yesterday, and I think
it is a great deal pleasanter here, so you have
really done me a favor. I am particularly glad
to see you, because, from the little I have heard
said about you, I think you must agree with some
of my cherished opinions. For one thing, I am
quite certain you favor the assertion of individuality;
your actions prove that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; said the bishop, seating himself near
her, &#8220;I have not given much thought to the
subject; but I suppose I have asserted my individuality.
If I have, however, I have done it
indefinitely. Everybody about me having some
definite purpose in life, and I having none, I am,
in a negative way, a distinctive individual. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
is a pity I am so different from other people,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is not a pity,&#8221; interrupted Corona, the
color coming into her cheeks and a brighter light
into her eyes. &#8220;Our individuality is a sacred responsibility.
It is given to us for us to protect
and encourage&mdash;I may say, to revere. It is a
trust for which we should be called to account by
ourselves, and we shall be false and disloyal to
ourselves if we cannot show that we have done
everything in our power for the establishment
and recognition of our individuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It delights me to hear you speak in that way,&#8221;
exclaimed the bishop. &#8220;It encourages and cheers
me. We are what we are; and if we can be
more fully what we are than we have been, then
we are more truly ourselves than before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what can be nobler,&#8221; cried Corona, &#8220;than
to be, in the most distinctive sense of the term,
ourselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Archibald walked together towards
their cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be neighborly and hospitable,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;but it seems to me that, now that the way
is clear for Miss Raybold to move her tent
to her own camp and set up house-keeping
there, we should not be called upon to entertain
her, and, if we want to enjoy ourselves in
our own way, we can do it without thinking of
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall certainly not do it,&#8221; said his wife,
&#8220;if we do think of her. I am very much disappointed
in her. She is not a companion at all for
Margery; she never speaks to her; and, on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
other hand, I should think you would wish she
would never speak to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said her husband, &#8220;that feeling did
grow upon me somewhat this afternoon. Up to
a certain point she is amusing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here he was interrupted by Mrs. Perkenpine,
who planted herself before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you think I didn&#8217;t do right,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;&#8217;cause, when that big bundle came it had your
name on it; but I knew it was clothes, and that
they was for that man in our camp, and so I
took them to him myself. I heard Phil say that
the sooner that man was up and dressed, the
better it would be for all parties; and as Martin
had gone off, and there wasn&#8217;t nobody to take
his clothes to him, I took them to him, and that&#8217;s
the long and short of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wondered how he got them,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald,
&#8220;but I am glad you carried them to him.&#8221;
Then, speaking to his wife, he added, &#8220;It may be
a good thing that I gave him a chance to assert
his individuality.&#8221;</p>

<p>About half an hour after the beginning of the
conversation between the bishop and Miss Corona,
Mrs. Perkenpine came to the latter and informed
her that supper was ready, and three times after
that first announcement did she repeat the information.
At last the bishop rose and said he
would not keep Miss Raybold from her meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you not join us?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I shall be
glad to have you do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop hesitated for a moment, and then
he accompanied Corona.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Perkenpine turned from the camp
cooking-stove, a long-handled pan, well filled with
slices of hot meat, in her hand, she stood for a
moment amazed. Slowly approaching the little
table outside of the tent were the bishop and
Miss Raybold, and glancing beyond them towards
the lake, she saw Clyde and Raybold, to
whom she had yelled that supper was ready, the
one with his arms folded, gazing out over the
water, and the other strolling backward and forward,
as if he had thought of going to his supper,
but had not quite made up his mind to it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkenpine&#8217;s face grew red. &#8220;They are
waitin&#8217; for a chance to speak to that Archibald
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
gal,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;Well, let them wait. And
she&#8217;s bringing him! She needn&#8217;t s&#8217;pose I don&#8217;t
know him. I&#8217;ve seen him splittin&#8217; wood at Sadler&#8217;s,
and I don&#8217;t cook for sech.&#8221; So saying, she
strode to some bushes a little back of the stove,
and dashed the panful of meat behind them.
Then she returned, and seizing the steaming coffee-pot,
she poured its contents on the ground.
Then she took up a smaller pan, containing some
fried potatoes, hot and savory, and these she
threw after the meat.</p>
<p>The bishop and Corona now reached the table
and seated themselves. Mrs. Perkenpine, her face
as hard and immovable as the trunk of an oak, approached,
and placed before them some slices of
cold bread, some butter, and two glasses of water.</p>
<p>Still earnestly talking, her eyes sometimes
dimmed with tears of excitement as she descanted
upon her favorite theories, Corona began to eat
what was before her. She buttered a slice of
bread, and if the bishop chanced to say anything
she ate some of it. She drank some water, and she
talked and talked and talked. She did not know
what she was eating. It might have been a Lord
Mayor&#8217;s dinner or a beggar&#8217;s crust; her mind
took no cognizance of such an unimportant matter.
As for her companion, he knew very well
what he was eating, and as he gazed about him,
and saw that there were no signs of anything
more, his heart sank lower and lower; but he
ate slice after slice of bread, for he was hungry,
and he hoped that when the two young men came
to the table they would call for more substantial
food.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>But long before they arrived Corona finished
her meal and rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we have had our supper,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;let us go where we shall not be annoyed by the
smell of food, and continue our conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible,&#8221; thought the bishop, &#8220;that she
can be annoyed by the smell of hot meat, potatoes,
and coffee? I suppose the delicious odor
comes from the other supper-table. Heavens!
Why wasn&#8217;t I asked there?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a dreadful storm when Raybold and
Clyde came to the table; but Mrs. Perkenpine
remained hard and immovable through it all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sister and that tramp has been here,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;and this is all there is left. If you keep
your hogs in your house, you can&#8217;t expect to
count on your victuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some more coffee was made, and that, with
bread, composed the young men&#8217;s supper.</p>
<p>When Arthur Raybold had finished his meal, he
walked to the spot where Corona and the bishop
were conversing, and stood there silently. He
was afraid to interrupt his sister by speaking to
her, but he thought that his presence might have
an effect upon her companion. It did have an
effect, for the bishop seized the opportunity
created by the arrival of a third party, excused
himself, and departed at the first break in Corona&#8217;s
flow of words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish, Arthur,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that when you see
I am engaged in a conversation, you would wait
at least a reasonable time before interrupting it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A reasonable time!&#8221; said Raybold, with a
laugh. &#8220;I like that! But I came here to interrupt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
your conversation. Do you know who that
fellow is you were talking to? He&#8217;s a common,
good-for-nothing tramp. He goes round splitting
wood for his meals. Clyde and I kept him
here to cook our meals because we had no servant,
and he&#8217;s been in bed for days because he
had no clothes to wear. Now you are treating
him as if he were a gentleman, and you actually
brought him to our table, where, like the half-starved
cur that he is, he has eaten up everything
fit to eat that we were to have for our
supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not eat all of it,&#8221; said Corona, &#8220;for
I ate some myself; and if he is the good-for-nothing
tramp and the other things you call him,
I wish I could meet with more such tramps. I
tell you, Arthur, that if you were to spend the
next five years in reading and studying, you
could not get into your mind one-tenth of the
serious information, the power to reason intelligently
upon your perceptions, the ability to collate,
compare, and refer to their individual causes
the impressions&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bosh!&#8221; said her brother. &#8220;What I want
to know is, are you going to make friends with
that man and invite him to our table?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall invite him if I see fit,&#8221; said she. &#8220;He
is an extremely intelligent person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered he, &#8220;if you do I shall have a
separate table,&#8221; and he walked away.</p>
<p>As soon as he had left Corona, the bishop repaired
to the Archibalds&#8217; cooking-tent, where he
saw Matlack at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come,&#8221; he said, with a pleasant smile,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
&#8220;to ask a very great favor. Would it be convenient
for you to give me something to eat? Anything
in the way of meat, hot or cold, and some
tea or coffee, as I see there is a pot still steaming
on your stove. I have had an unlucky experience.
You know I have been preparing my own
meals at the other camp, but to-day, when Mrs.
Perkenpine brought me my clothes, she carried
away with her all the provisions that had been
left there. I supped, it is true, with Miss Raybold,
but her appetite is so delicate and her fare
so extremely simple that I confidentially acknowledge
that I am half starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>During these remarks Matlack had stood quietly
gazing at the bishop. &#8220;Do you see that pile
of logs and branches there?&#8221; said he; &#8220;that&#8217;s
the firewood that&#8217;s got to be cut for to-morrow,
which is Sunday, when we don&#8217;t want to be cuttin&#8217;
wood; and if you&#8217;ll go to work and cut it into
pieces to fit this stove, I&#8217;ll give you your supper.
You can go to the other camp and sleep where
you have been sleepin&#8217;, if you want to, and in the
mornin&#8217; I&#8217;ll give you your breakfast. I &#8217;ain&#8217;t got
no right to give you Mr. Archibald&#8217;s victuals, but
what you eat I&#8217;ll pay for out of my own pocket,
considerin&#8217; that you&#8217;ll do my work. Then to-morrow
I&#8217;ll give you just one hour after you&#8217;ve
finished your breakfast to get out of this camp
altogether, entirely out of my sight. I tried to
have you sent away before, but other people took
you up, and so I said no more; but now things
are different. When a man pulls up what I&#8217;ve
drove down, and sets loose what I&#8217;ve locked up,
and the same as snaps his fingers in my face when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
I&#8217;m attendin&#8217; to my business, then I don&#8217;t let
that man stay in my camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;but in case I
should not go away within the time specified,
what would be your course?&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few brief remarks, inelegant but expressive,
the guide outlined his intentions of taking
measures which would utterly eliminate the physical
energy of the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t taken no advantage of you,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t come down on you when you
hadn&#8217;t no clothes to go away in; and now that
you&#8217;ve got good clothes, I don&#8217;t want to spile
them if I can help it; but they&#8217;re not goin&#8217; to
save you&mdash;mind my words. What I&#8217;ve said I&#8217;ll
stick to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Matlack,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;I consider
that you are entirely correct in all your positions.
As to that unfortunate affair of the boat, I had
intended coming to you and apologizing most
sincerely for my share in it. It was an act of
great foolishness, but that does not in the least
excuse me. I apologize now, and beg that you
will believe that I truly regret having interfered
with your arrangements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do!&#8221; exclaimed the guide. &#8220;When
a man as much as snaps his fingers in my face,
it&#8217;s no use for him to come and apologize. That&#8217;s
not what I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;you will pardon
me if I insist upon expressing my regrets. I
do that for my own sake as well as yours; but
we will drop that subject. When you ask me to
cut wood to pay for my meals, you are entirely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
right, and I honor your sound opinion upon this
subject. I will cut the wood and earn my meals,
but there is one amendment to your plan which
I would like to propose. To-morrow is Sunday;
for that reason we should endeavor to make the
day as quiet and peaceable as possible, and we
should avoid everything which may be difficult
of explanation or calculated to bring about an
unpleasant difference of opinion among other
members of the party. Therefore, will you postpone
the time at which you will definitely urge
my departure until Monday morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Matlack, &#8220;now I come to think of it,
it might be well not to kick up a row on Sunday,
and I will put it off until Monday morning; but
mind, there&#8217;s no nonsense about me. What I say I
mean, and on Monday morning you march of your
own accord, or I&#8217;ll attend to the matter myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said the bishop; &#8220;thank you
very much. To-morrow I will consider your invitation
to leave this place, and if you will come
to Camp Roy about half-past six on Monday
morning I will then give you my decision. Will
that hour suit you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Matlack, &#8220;you might as well
make it a business matter. It&#8217;s going to be business
on my side, I&#8217;d have you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good&mdash;very good,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;and
now let me get at that wood.&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, he put down his cane, took off his
hat, his coat, his waistcoat, his collar, and his
cravat and his cuffs; he rolled up his sleeves, he
turned up the bottoms of his trousers, and then
taking an axe, he set to work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>In a few minutes Martin arrived on the scene.
&#8220;What&#8217;s up now?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s cuttin&#8217; wood for his meals,&#8221; replied Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were going to bounce him as
soon as he got up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s put off until Monday morning,&#8221; said
Matlack. &#8220;Then he marches. I&#8217;ve settled
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he agree?&#8221; asked Martin.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t necessary for him to agree; he&#8217;ll find
that out Monday morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin stood and looked at the bishop as he
worked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would get him to cut wood every
day,&#8221; said he. &#8220;By George, how he makes that
axe fly!&#8221;</p>
<p>When the bishop finished his work he drove
his axe-head deep into a stump, washed his hands
and his face, resumed the clothing he had laid
aside, and then sat down to supper. There was
nothing stingy about Matlack, and the wood-chopper
made a meal which amply compensated
him for the deficiencies of the Perkenpine repast.</p>
<p>When he had finished he hurried to the spot
where the party was in the habit of assembling
around the camp-fire. He found there some
feebly burning logs, and Mr. Clyde, who sat alone,
smoking his pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; asked the bishop.
&#8220;Where are all our friends?&#8221;</p>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they are all in bed,&#8221; said Clyde,
&#8220;with the bedclothes pulled over their heads&mdash;that is, except one, and I suspect she is talking in
her sleep. They were all here as usual, and Mr.
Archibald thought he would break the spell by
telling a fishing story. He told me he was going
to try to speak against time; but it wasn&#8217;t of
any use. She just slid into the middle of his remarks
as a duck slides into the water, and then
she began an oration. I really believe she did
not know that any one else was talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may have been the case,&#8221; said the bishop;
&#8220;she has a wonderful power of self-concentration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; said Clyde, &#8220;and this time she concentrated
herself so much upon herself that the
rest of us got away, one by one, and when all the
others had gone she went. Then, when I found
she really had gone, I came back. By-the-way,
bishop,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;there is something I
would like to do, and I want you to help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Name it,&#8221; said the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am getting tired of the way the Raybolds
are trespassing on the good-nature of the Archibalds,
and, whatever they do, I don&#8217;t intend to
let them make me trespass any longer. I haven&#8217;t
anything to do with Miss Raybold, but the other
tent belongs as much to me as it does to her
brother, and I am going to take it back to our
own camp. And what is more, I am going to
have my meals there. I don&#8217;t want that wooden-headed
Mrs. Perkenpine to cook for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like me to do it?&#8221; asked the
bishop, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be fine,&#8221; said Clyde. &#8220;I will help,
and we will set up house-keeping there again, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
if Raybold doesn&#8217;t choose to come and live in his
own camp he can go wherever he pleases. I am
not going to have him manage things for me.
Don&#8217;t you think that you and I can carry that
tent over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With ease!&#8221; exclaimed the bishop. &#8220;When
do you want to move&mdash;Monday morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Clyde, &#8220;after breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE HERMITS ASSOCIATE</h3>
</div>

<p>During the next day no one in camp had reason
to complain of Corona Raybold. She did not
seem inclined to talk to anybody, but spent the
most of her time alone. She wrote a little and
reflected a great deal, sometimes walking, sometimes
seated in the shade, gazing far beyond the
sky.</p>
<p>When the evening fire was lighted, her mood
changed so that one might have supposed that
another fire had been lighted somewhere in the
interior of her mental organism. Her fine eyes
glistened, her cheeks gently reddened, and her
whole body became animated with an energy
created by warm emotions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have something I wish to say to you all,&#8221;
she exclaimed, as she reached the fire. &#8220;Where
is Arthur? Will somebody please call him? And
I would like to see both the guides. It is something
very important that I have to say. Mrs.
Perkenpine will be here in a moment; I asked
her to come. If Mr. Matlack is not quite ready,
can he not postpone what he is doing? I am
sure you will all be interested in what I have to
say, and I do not want to begin until every one
is here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>Mr. Archibald saw that she was very much in
earnest, and so he sent for the guides, and Clyde
went to call Raybold.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Clyde returned and told Corona
that her brother had said he did not care
to attend services that evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; asked Miss Raybold.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is sitting over there looking out upon the
lake,&#8221; replied Clyde.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be back almost immediately,&#8221; said she
to Mr. Archibald, &#8220;and in the mean time please
let everybody assemble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arthur Raybold was in no mood to attend services
of any sort. He had spent nearly the whole
day trying to get a chance to speak to Margery,
but never could he find her alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can once put the matter plainly to her,&#8221;
he said to himself, &#8220;she will quickly perceive
what it is that I offer her; and when she clearly
sees that, I will undertake to make her accept it.
She is only a woman, and can no more withstand
me than a mound of sand built by a baby&#8217;s hand
could withstand the rolling wave.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment Corona arrived and told him
that she wanted him at the camp-fire. He was
only a man, and could no more withstand her
than a mound of sand built by a baby&#8217;s hand
could withstand the rolling wave.</p>
<p>When everybody in the camp had gathered
around the fire, Corona, her eye-glasses illumined
by the light of her soul, gazed around the circle
and began to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear friends,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have been
thinking a great deal to-day upon a very important
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
subject, and I have come to the conclusion
that we who form this little company have before
us one of the grandest opportunities ever
afforded a group of human beings. We are here,
apart from our ordinary circumstances and avocations,
free from all the trammels and demands
of society, alone with nature and ourselves. In
our ordinary lives, surrounded by our ordinary
circumstances, we cannot be truly ourselves;
each of us is but part of a whole, and very often
an entirely unharmonious part. It is very seldom
that we are able to do the things we wish to
do in the manner and at times and places when
it would best suit our natures. Try as we may
to be true to ourselves, it is seldom possible; we
are swept away in a current of conventionality.
It may be one kind of conventionality for some
of us and another kind for others, but we are
borne on by it all the same. Sometimes a person
like myself or Mr. Archibald clings to some rock
or point upon the bank, and for a little while is
free from the coercion of circumstances, but this
cannot be for long, and we are soon swept with
the rest into the ocean of conglomerate commonplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when we die!&#8221; remarked Mrs. Perkenpine,
who sat reverently listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the speaker, &#8220;it happens while we
are alive. But now,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;we have a
chance, as I said before, to shake ourselves free
from our enthralment. For a little while each
one of us may assert his or her individuality. We
are a varied and representative party; we come
from different walks of life; we are men, women,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
and&mdash;&#8221; looking at Margery, she was about to say
children, but she changed her expression to
&#8220;young people.&#8221; &#8220;I think you will all understand
what I mean. When we are at our homes
we do things because other people want us to do
them, and not because we want to do them. A
family sits down to a meal, and some of them like
what is on the table, some do not; some of them
would have preferred to eat an hour before, some
of them would prefer to eat an hour later; but
they all take their meals at the same time and
eat the same things because it is the custom to
do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mention a meal simply as an instance, but
the slavery of custom extends into every branch
of our lives. We get up, we go to bed, we read,
we work, we play, just as other people do these
things, and not as we ourselves would do them if
we planned our own lives. Now we have a chance,
all of us, to be ourselves! Each of us may say, &#8216;I
am myself, one!&#8217; Think of that, my friends, each
one! Each of us a unit, responsible only to his
or her unity, if I may so express it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that I am that?&#8221; inquired Mrs.
Perkenpine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; replied Corona.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Phil Matlack one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the female guide; &#8220;if he is
one, I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what I propose is this,&#8221; said Corona: &#8220;I
understand that the stay in this camp will continue
for about a week longer, and I earnestly
urge upon you that for this time we shall each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
one of us assert our individuality. Let us be what
we are, show ourselves what we are, and let each
other see what we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would not be safe nor pleasant to allow everybody
to do that,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald. He was
more interested in Miss Raybold&#8217;s present discourse
than he had been in any other he had
heard her deliver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it would not do to propose
such a thing to the criminal classes or to
people of evil inclinations, but I have carefully
considered the whole subject as it relates to us,
and I think we are a party singularly well calculated
to become the exponent of the distinctiveness
of our several existences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That gits me,&#8221; said Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; said the speaker, gazing kindly
at him, &#8220;that I do not always express myself
plainly to the general comprehension, but what I
mean is this: that during the time we stay here,
let each one of us do exactly what he or she wants
to do, without considering other people at all, except,
of course, that we must not do anything
which would interfere with any of the others doing
what they please. For instance&mdash;and I assure
you I have thought over this matter in all its details&mdash;if
any of us were inclined to swear or behave
disorderly, which I am sure could not be the
case, he or she would not do so because he or she
would feel that, being responsible to himself or
herself, that responsibility would prevent him or
her from doing that which would interfere with
the pleasure or comfort of his or her associates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, somewhat severely,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
&#8220;that our duty to our fellow-beings is far
more important than our selfish consideration of
ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But reflect,&#8221; cried Corona, &#8220;how much consideration
we give to our fellow-beings, and how
little to ourselves as ourselves, each one. Can we
not, for the sake of knowing ourselves and honoring
ourselves, give ourselves to ourselves for a
little while? The rest of our lives may then be
given to others and the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly believe,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;that
all of us clearly understand your meaning, but it
seems to me that you would like each one of us
to become, for a time, a hermit. I do not know
of any other class of persons who so thoroughly
assert their individuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right!&#8221; exclaimed Corona. &#8220;A hermit
does it. A hermit is more truly himself than
any other man. He may dwell in a cave and eat
water-cresses, he may live on top of a tall pillar,
or he may make his habitation in a barrel! If a
hermit should so choose, he might furnish a cave
with Eastern rugs and bric-&agrave;-brac. If he liked
that sort of thing, he would be himself. Yes, I
would have all of us, in the truest sense of the
word, hermits, each a hermit; but we need not
dwell apart. Some of us would certainly wish to
assert our individuality by not dwelling apart
from others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might, then,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;become
a company of associate hermits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; cried Corona, stretching out her
hands. &#8220;That is the very word&mdash;associate hermits.
My dear friends, from to-morrow morning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
until we leave here, let us be associate
hermits. Let us live for ourselves, be true to
ourselves. After all, if we think of it seriously,
ourselves are all that we have in this world.
Everything else may be taken from us, but no
one can take from me, myself, or from any one
of you, yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop now rose. He as well as the others
had listened attentively to everything that had
been said; even Arthur Raybold had shown a
great deal of interest in his sister&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;that while we
stay here each one of us shall act exactly as we
think we ought to act if we were not influenced
by the opinions and examples of others around
us, and thus we shall have an opportunity to find
out for ourselves and show others exactly what
we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is it,&#8221; said Corona, &#8220;you have stated it
very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;I move that for
the time stated we individually assert our individuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Second the motion,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;All in favor of this motion please say &#8216;Aye,&#8217;&#8221;
said Corona. &#8220;Now let everybody vote, and I
hope you will all say &#8216;Aye,&#8217; and if any one does
not understand, I will be happy to explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know,&#8221; said Phil Matlack, rising, &#8220;if
one man asserts what you call his individ&#8217;ality in
such a way that it runs up agin another man&#8217;s,
and that second man ain&#8217;t inclined to stand it, if
that&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I assure you,&#8221; interrupted the bishop,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
&#8220;that that will be all right. I understand you
perfectly, and the individualities will all run
along together without interfering with each
other, and if one happens to get in the way of
another it will be gently moved aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gently!&#8221; said Matlack, somewhat satirically.
&#8220;Well, all right, it will be moved aside. I am
satisfied, if the rest are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now all in favor say &#8216;Aye,&#8217;&#8221; said Corona.</p>
<p>They all said &#8220;Aye,&#8221; except Mrs. Perkenpine,
who said &#8220;Me.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>MARGERY&#8217;S BREAKFAST</h3>
</div>

<p>Very early the next morning Margery pushed
wide open the window of her studio chamber.
The sash was a large one, and opened outward on
hinges. She looked out upon the dewy foliage,
she inhaled the fragrance of the moist morning
air, she listened to the song of some early birds,
and then, being dressed for the day, she got on a
chair, stepped on the window-sill, and jumped
out. She walked quietly round the cabin and
went out towards the lake. She had never seen
the woods so early in the day. All the space between
the earth and the sky seemed filled with
an intoxicating coolness. She took off her hat
and carried it in her hand; the sun was not yet
high enough to make it necessary to put anything
between him and her.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what I am,&#8221; said Margery to herself
as she stepped blithely on. &#8220;I never knew before
what I am. I am really a dryad under difficulties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently, to her amazement and his amazement,
she saw Martin. She went towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Martin,&#8221; she said, &#8220;are you up so early?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;This is not early for me,&#8221; he answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And Mr. Matlack, is he up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, he is up, and gone off to attend to
some business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, really!&#8221; exclaimed Margery. &#8220;I thought
I was the first one out in the world to-day. And
now, Martin, don&#8217;t you want to do something for
me? I did not think it would happen, but I am
really dreadfully hungry, and couldn&#8217;t you give
me my breakfast now, by myself, before anybody
else? I am not particular what I have&mdash;anything
that is easy to get ready will do&mdash;and I would like
it down at the very edge of the lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall have it!&#8221; exclaimed Martin, eagerly.
&#8220;I will get it ready for you very soon, and will
bring it to you. I know you like bread and butter
and jam, and there is some cold meat, and I
will boil you an egg and make some coffee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be lovely,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;and I
will go down by the lake and wait. I do believe,&#8221;
she said to herself as she hurried away, &#8220;that this
hermit business is the only sensible thing that
ever came into the head of that classic statue
with the glass fronts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very soon Martin appeared with a rug, which
he said she would want if she were going to sit
on the ground; and then he ran away, but soon
came back with the breakfast. Margery was surprised
to see how tastefully it was served.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could not have done it better,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;if you had been a&#8221;&mdash;she was about to say waiter,
but as she gazed at the bright, handsome face of
the young man she felt that it would hurt his feelings
to use such a word, so she suddenly changed
it to woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it is done well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is not because
I am like a woman, but because you are one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; thought Margery;
but she did not stop to consider. &#8220;Thank you
very much,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Here is where I am going
to eat, and nobody will disturb me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish anything else?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I have everything I want;
you know I take only one cup of coffee.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did know it; he knew everything she took,
and as he felt that there was no excuse for him
to stay there any longer, he slowly walked away.</p>
<p>The place Margery had chosen was a nice little
nook for a nice little hermit. It was a bit of low
beach, very narrow, and flanked on the shore side
by a row of bushes, which soon turned and grew
down to the water&#8217;s edge, thus completely cutting
off one end of the beach. At the other end the
distance between the shrubbery and the water
was but a few feet, so that Margery could eat her
breakfast without being disturbed by the rest of
the world.</p>
<p>Reclining on the rug with the little tray on the
ground before her, and some green leaves and a
few pale wild flowers peeping over the edge of it
to see what she had for breakfast, Margery gave
herself up to the enjoyment of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each, one,&#8221; she said aloud; &#8220;I am one, and
beautiful nature is another. Just two of us, and
each, one. Go away, sir,&#8221; she said to a big buzzing
creature with transparent wings, &#8220;you are
another, but you don&#8217;t count.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arthur Raybold was perhaps the member of
the party who was the best satisfied to be himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
He had vowed, as he left the camp-fire the night
before, that his sister had at last evolved an idea
which had some value. Be himself? He should
think so! He firmly believed that he was the
only person in the camp capable of truly acting
his own part in life.</p>
<p>Clyde had told him that on this morning he
was going to move the tent over to their own
camp, and though he had objected very forcibly,
he found that Clyde was not to be moved, and
that the tent would be. In an angry mood he
had been the first one of the Associated Hermits
to assert his individuality. He made up his mind
that he would not leave the immediate atmosphere
of Margery. He would revolve about her
in his waking hours and in his dreams, and in the
latter case he would revolve in a hammock hung
between two trees not far from his sister&#8217;s tent;
and as he was not one who delayed the execution
of his plans, he had put up the hammock that
night, although his tent was still in Camp Rob.
He had not slept very well, because he was not
used to repose in a hammock; and he had risen
early, for, though wrapped in a blanket, he
had found himself a little chilly.</p>
<p>Starting out for a brisk walk to warm himself,
he had not gone far before he thought he heard
something which sounded like the clicking of
knife and fork and dish. He stopped, listened, and
then approached the source of the sounds, and
soon stood at the open end of Margery&#8217;s little
beach. For a few moments she did not know
he was there, so engrossed was her mind with
the far-away shadows on the lake, and with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
the piece of bread and jam she held in her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, happy Fates!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;How have
ye befriended me! Could I have believed such
rare fortune was in store for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the sound of his voice Margery turned her
head and started, and in the same instant she was
on her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; he said, without approaching her,
but extending his arms so that one hand touched
the bushes and the other reached over the water,
&#8220;I have you a gentle prisoner. I consider this
the most fortunate hour of my whole existence.
All I ask of you is to listen to me for ten minutes,
and then I will cease to stand guard at the entrance
to your little haven, and although you will
be free to go where you please, I know you will
not go away from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery&#8217;s face was on fire. She was so angry
she could scarcely speak, but she managed to
bring some words to her lips to express her condition
of mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Raybold,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;if I ever hear any
more of that horrid trash from you I will speak
to Mr. Archibald, and have him drive you out of
this camp. I haven&#8217;t spoken to him before because
I thought it would make trouble and interfere
with people who have not done anything but
what is perfectly right, but this is the last time I
am going to let you off, and I would like you to
remember that. Now go away this instant, or
else step aside and let me pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raybold did not change his position, but with
a smile of indulgent condescension he remarked:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, you are angry; but I don&#8217;t mind
that, and I am quite sure you do not mean it.
You see, you have never heard all that I have to
say to you. When I have fully spoken to you,
then I have no fear&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He had not finished his sentence, when Margery
dashed into the water, utterly regardless of
her clothes, and before the astonished intruder
could advance towards her she had rushed past
him, and had run up on dry land a yard or two
behind him. The water on the shelving beach
was not more than a foot deep, but her mad
bounds made a splashing and a spattering of
spray as if a live shark bad been dropped into the
shallow water. In a moment she had left the
beach and was face to face with Martin, pale with
fright.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you had tumbled in!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;What on earth is the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had no breath to answer, but she turned
her head towards the lake, and as Martin looked
that way he saw Raybold advancing from behind
the bushes. It required no appreciable time for
the young guide to understand the situation.
His whole form quivered, his hands involuntarily
clinched, his brows knitted, and he made one
quick step forward; but only one, for Margery
seized him by the wrist. Without knowing what
he was doing, he struggled to free himself from
her, but she was strong and held him fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go to my tent,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;I am all
wet. Now promise me that you will not say a thing
or do a thing until I see you again. Promise!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment he seemed undecided, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
he ceased his efforts to get away, and said, &#8220;I
promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery dropped his arm and hurried towards
the cabin, hoping earnestly that the Archibalds
were not yet up.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a gay and lively beginning for a hermit,&#8221;
she thought, as she made her way around
the house, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t see how on earth I am
ever going to get through that window again.
There is nothing to stand on. I did not expect
to go back until they were all up.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when she reached the window there was a
stout wooden stool placed below it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin did that,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;while I was
at my breakfast. He knew I must have come
through the window, and might want to go back
that way. Oh dear!&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;But I am sure
I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221; And so, mounting from the stool
to the window-sill, she entered her room.</p>
<p>Having given his promise, Martin turned his
back upon the sombre young man, who, with
folded arms and clouded brow, was stalking towards
the tents at the other end of the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I look at him,&#8221; said Martin, &#8220;it may be
that I could not keep my promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was about half an hour afterwards, when
Martin, still excited and still pale, was getting
ready for the general breakfast, forgetting entirely
that he was a hermit, and that some of the
other hermits might have peculiar ideas about
their morning meal, that Phil Matlack arrived on
the scene. Martin was very much engrossed in
his own thoughts, but he could not repress an inquiring
interest in his companion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;did you bounce him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Matlack made no answer, but began to cut out
the top of a tin can.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; repeated Martin, &#8220;did you bounce him,
or did he go without it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without turning towards the younger man,
Matlack remarked: &#8220;I was mistaken. That ain&#8217;t
fat; it&#8217;s muscle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say,&#8221; exclaimed Martin,
in astonishment, &#8220;that he bounced you out of
that camp!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to say nothin&#8217;,&#8221; was the reply,
&#8220;except what I do say; and what I say is that
that ain&#8217;t fat; it&#8217;s muscle. When I make a mistake
I don&#8217;t mind standin&#8217; up and sayin&#8217; so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin could not understand the situation.
He knew Matlack to be a man of great courage
and strength, and one who, if he should engage
in a personal conflict, would not give up until he
had done his very best. But the guide&#8217;s appearance
gave no signs of any struggle. His clothes
were in their usual order, and his countenance
was quiet and composed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; cried Martin, &#8220;how did you find
out all that about the bishop?&#8221;</p>
<p>Matlack turned on him with a grim smile.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you tell me that day you was talkin&#8217; to
me about the boat that he was a tough sort of a
fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; said the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Matlack, &#8220;how did you find that
out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin laughed. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;if we were about square. Well, if you will tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
me how you found it out, I will tell you how I
did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; said the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;The long and short of my business with him,&#8221;
said Martin, &#8220;was this: I went with him down to
the lake, and there I gave him a piece of my
mind; and when I had finished, he turned on me
and grabbed me with his two hands and chucked
me out into the water, just as if I had been a bag
of bad meal that he wanted to get rid of. When
I got out I was going to fight him, but he advised
me not to, and when I took a look at him and remembered
the feel of the swing he gave me, I took
his advice. Now what did he do to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t do nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said Matlack. &#8220;When
I got to the little tent he sleeps in, there he was
sittin&#8217; in front of it, as smilin&#8217; as a basket of chips,
and he bade me good-mornin&#8217; as if I had been a
tenant comin&#8217; to pay him his rent; and then he
said that before we went on with the business between
us, there was some things he would like to
show me, and he had &#8217;em all ready. So he steps
off to a place a little behind the tent, and there
was three great bowlders, whopping big stones,
which he said he had brought out of the woods.
I could hardly believe him, but there they was.
&#8216;You don&#8217;t mean,&#8217; says I, &#8216;that you are goin&#8217; to
fight with stones; because, if you are, you ought
to give me a chance to get some,&#8217; and I thought
to myself that I would pick up rocks that could
be heaved. &#8216;Oh no,&#8217; says he, with one of them
smiles of his&mdash;&#8216;oh no; I just want to open our
conference with a little gymnastic exhibition.&#8217;
And so sayin&#8217;, he rolled up his shirt-sleeves&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
hadn&#8217;t no coat on&mdash;and he picked up one of them
rocks with both hands, and then he gave it a
swing with one hand, like you swing a ten-pin
ball, and he sent that rock about thirty feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It nearly took my breath away, for if I had to
move such a stone I&#8217;d want a wheelbarrow. Then
he took another of the rocks and hurled it right
on top of the first one, and it came down so hard
that it split itself in half. And then he took up
the third one, which was the biggest, and threw
it nearly as far, but it didn&#8217;t hit the others.
&#8216;Now, Mr. Matlack,&#8217; says he, &#8216;this is the first part
of my little programme. I have only one or two
more things, and I don&#8217;t want to keep you long.&#8217;
Then he went and got a hickory sapling that he&#8217;d
cut down. It was just the trunk part of it, and
must have been at least three inches thick. He
put the middle of it at the back of his neck, and
then he took hold of the two ends with his hands
and pulled forward, and, by George! he broke
that stick right in half!</p>
<p>&#8220;Then says he, &#8216;Would you mind steppin&#8217;
down to the lake?&#8217; I didn&#8217;t mind, and went
with him, and when we got down to the water
there was their boat drawed up on the shore and
pretty nigh full of water. &#8216;Mr. Clyde brought
this boat back the other day,&#8217; says he, &#8216;from a
place where he left it some distance down the
lake, and I wonder he didn&#8217;t sink before he got
here. We must try and calk up some of the
open seams; but first we&#8217;ve got to get the water
out of her.&#8217; So sayin&#8217;, he squatted down on the
ground in front of the boat and took hold of it,
one hand on one side of the bow and one on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
other, and then he gave a big twist, and just
turned the boat clean over, water and all, so that
it lay with its bottom up, and the water running
down into the lake like a little deluge.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That ought to have been done long ago,&#8217; says
he, &#8216;and I&#8217;ll come down after a while and calk it
before the sun gets on it.&#8217; Then he walked back
to camp as spry as a robin, and then says he, &#8216;Mr.
Matlack, my little exhibition is over, and so we&#8217;ll
go ahead with the business you proposed.&#8217; I
looked around, and says I: &#8216;Do you find that
little tent you sleep in comfortable? It seems to
me as if your feet must stick out of it.&#8217; &#8216;They
do,&#8217; says he, &#8216;and I sometimes throw a blanket
over them to keep them dry. But we are goin&#8217;
to make different arrangements here. Mr. Clyde
and I will bring down his tent after breakfast,
and if Mr. Raybold doesn&#8217;t choose to occupy it,
Mr. Clyde says I may share it with him. At any
rate, I&#8217;ve engaged to attend to the cookin&#8217; and to
things in general in this camp durin&#8217; the rest of
the time we stay here.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And so Mr. Clyde is tired of trespassin&#8217;, is
he?&#8217; says I. &#8216;Yes, he is,&#8217; says he; &#8216;he&#8217;s a high-minded
young fellow, and doesn&#8217;t fancy that sort
of thing. Mr. Raybold slept last night in a hammock,
and if that suits him, he may keep it up.&#8217;
&#8216;If I was you,&#8217; says I, &#8216;if he does come back to
the camp, I&#8217;d make him sleep in that little tent.
It would fit him better than it does you.&#8217; &#8216;Oh
no,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to make no trouble.
I&#8217;m willin&#8217; to sleep anywhere. I&#8217;m used to roughin&#8217;
it, and I could make myself comfortable in any
tent I ever saw.&#8217; &#8216;Well,&#8217; says I, &#8216;that was a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
pretty exhibition you gave me, and I am much
obliged to you, but I must be goin&#8217; over to my
camp to help get breakfast.&#8217; &#8216;If you see Mr.
Clyde,&#8217; says he, &#8216;will you kindly tell him that I
will come over and help him with his tent in
about an hour?&#8217; To which I said I would, and I
left. Now then, hurry up. Them hermits will
want their breakfasts.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>MARTIN ASSERTS HIS INDIVIDUALITY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said Mr. Clyde, as he approached
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald, seated opposite
each other at their breakfast-table. &#8220;So you
still eat together? Don&#8217;t ask me to join you; I
have had my breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;we did think that,
as we were hermits, we ought to eat in some separate,
out-of-the-way fashion; but we could not
think of any, and as we were both hungry and
liked the same things, we concluded to postpone
the assertion of our individualities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Miss Dearborn?&#8221; asked Clyde.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she had her breakfast long ago, so she told
us,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;I suppose she took
some bread and jam, for I do not know what else
she could have had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for me,&#8221; said Clyde, &#8220;I thought I would do
something of the sort. I like an early breakfast,
and so I turned out, more than an hour ago and
went to look up Mrs. Perkenpine; and I might as
well say, sir, that I am now looking for the bishop
to come and help me carry our tent back to our
own camp, where he is going to cook for us. I
never wanted to be a trespasser on your premises,
and I don&#8217;t intend to be such any longer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the right feeling,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald;
&#8220;although, in fact, it doesn&#8217;t make any difference
to us whether your party camps here or not. At
first I thought it would, but I find it does not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By which he means,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald,
&#8220;that if you want to go away he is perfectly willing
to have you stay, but if you don&#8217;t want to
go away he doesn&#8217;t like it, and would have you
move.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clyde laughed. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything to say for
the others,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but as long as I have
a camp of my own I think I ought to live there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about Mrs. Perkenpine?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Archibald. &#8220;Did you find her willing to wait on
you, one at a time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; said Clyde. &#8220;I discovered her,
by her kitchen tent, hard at work eating her own
breakfast. I must have looked surprised, for she
lost no time in telling me that she was a hermit,
and was living for one person at a time&mdash;herself
first&mdash;and that she was mighty glad to get a
chance to have her breakfast before anybody
else, for she was always hungry and hated waiting.
I looked at the table, and saw that she had
the breakfast ready for the whole party; so I
said, &#8216;I am a hermit too, and I am living for myself,
and so I am going to sit down and eat.&#8217;
&#8216;Squat,&#8217; said she, and down I sat; and I had the
best meal of her cooking that I have yet tasted.
I told her so, and she said she shouldn&#8217;t wonder.
&#8216;Because,&#8217; said she, &#8216;I cooked this breakfast for
myself&mdash;me, one&mdash;and as I wasn&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; what
other people &#8217;d like, I got things a little more
tasty than common, I guess.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And what does she expect Miss Raybold and
her brother to do?&#8221; asked Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;When she had finished she got up,&#8221; Clyde answered,
&#8220;and went away, merely remarking that
the victuals were there, and when the others were
ready for them they might come and get them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;that Matlack
will not fancy that sort of a hermit life. But as
for me, I am greatly taken with the scheme. I
think I shall like it. Is Miss Raybold about
yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see nothing of her,&#8221; said Clyde, looking
over towards her tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, rising. &#8220;Harriet,
if you want me, I shall be in my cave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is that?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t say exactly where it will be,&#8221; he
answered, &#8220;but if you will go down to the shore
of the lake and blow four times on the dinner-horn
I&#8217;ll come to you, cave and all. I can easily
pull it over the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, with a
smile, &#8220;that we are associate hermits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I do not,&#8221; said her husband, &#8220;I remember
it, and that is the reason I am off before Miss
Raybold emerges upon the scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald to Clyde,
&#8220;exactly how I am going to assert myself to-day,
but I shall do it one way or the other; I am not
going to be left out in the cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clyde smiled, but he had no suggestion to offer;
his mind was filled with the conjecture as to what
sort of a hermit life Margery was going to lead,
and if she had already begun it. But just then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
the bishop came up, and together they went to
carry the tent back to Camp Roy.</p>
<p>It was at least an hour afterwards, and Mrs.
Archibald was comfortably seated in the shade
darning stockings, with an open book in her lap.
Sometimes she would read a little in the book
and then she would make some long and careful
stitches in the stocking, and then she would look
about her as if she greatly enjoyed combining her
work and her recreation in such a lovely place on
such a lovely summer morning. During one of
these periods of observation she perceived Corona
Raybold approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said the elder lady. &#8220;Is this
your first appearance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Corona, with a gentle smile. &#8220;When
I woke this morning I found myself to be an individual
who liked to lie in bed and gaze out
through an open fold in my tent upon the world
beyond, and so I lay and dozed and gazed, until
I felt like getting up, and then I got up, and you
cannot imagine how bright and happy I felt as I
thought of what I had been doing. For one
morning at least I had been true to myself, without
regard to other people or what they might
think about it. To-morrow, if I feel like it, I shall
rise at dawn, and go out and look at the stars
struggling with Aurora. Whatever my personal
instincts happen to be, I shall be loyal to them.
Now how do you propose to assert your individuality?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;I cannot
do that exactly as I would like to. If we had
not promised my daughter and her husband that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
we would stay away for a month, I should go directly
home and superintend my jelly-making
and fruit-preserving; but as I cannot do that, I
have determined to act out my own self here. I
shall darn stockings and sew or read, and try to
make myself comfortable and happy, just as I
would if I were sitting on my broad piazza, at
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Corona. &#8220;I think it likely that
you will be more true to yourself than any of us.
Doubtless you were born to be the head of a domestic
household, and if you followed your own
inclination you would be that if you were adrift
with your family on a raft in the middle of the
ocean. Now I am going away to see what further
suggestions my nature has to offer me.
What is Mr. Archibald doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald smiled. She knew what Corona&#8217;s
nature would suggest if she met a man
who could talk, or rather, listen. &#8220;Oh, his nature
has prompted him to hie away to the haunts
of game, and to stay there until he is half
starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Raybold heaved a little sigh. &#8220;I see very
few persons about here,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;only the two
guides, in fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;the bishop has
gone to help Mr. Clyde with his tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corona moved slowly away, and as she walked
her nature suggested that she would better eat
something, so she repaired to the scene of Mrs.
Perkenpine&#8217;s ordinary operations. There she
found that good woman stretched flat on her
back on the ground, fast asleep. Her face and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
body were shaded by some overhanging branches,
but her great feet were illumined and gilded
by the blazing sun. On a camp table near by
were the remains of the breakfast. It had been
there for two or three hours. Arthur Raybold
had taken what he wanted and had gone, and before
composing herself for her nap Mrs. Perkenpine
had thrown over it a piece of mosquito-netting.</p>
<p>Corona smiled. &#8220;Their natures are coming
out beautifully,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It really does me
good to see how admirably the scheme is unfolding
itself.&#8221; She sat down and ate what she
could find to her taste, but it was not much. &#8220;I
shall send for some fruit and some biscuit and
some other little things,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;that I
can keep in my tent and eat when I please.
That will suit me much better than the ordinary
meals.&#8221; Then, without awakening Mrs. Perkenpine,
she strolled away, directing her steps towards
Camp Roy.</p>
<p>When Margery had gone to her room, and had
changed her wet clothes, she was thoroughly
miserable. For some time she sat on the side of
her little cot, unwilling to go out, on account of a
nervous fear that she might meet Mr. Raybold.
Of course, if he should again speak to her as he
had done, she would immediately appeal to Mr.
Archibald, but she did not want to do this, for she
had a very strong desire not to make any trouble
or divisions in the camp; so she lay down to think
over the matter, and in less than two minutes she
was asleep. Mrs. Archibald had come to call her
to breakfast, but upon being told that she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
been up ever so long, and had had her breakfast,
she left the girl to her nap.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall sleep here,&#8221; thought Margery, &#8220;until
they have all gone to do whatever it is they want
to do, and then perhaps I may have a little
peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she awoke it was nearly eleven o&#8217;clock,
and she went immediately to her little side window,
from which she could see the lake and a
good deal of the camp-ground. The first thing
which met her reconnoitering gaze was a small boat
some distance out on the lake. Its oars were revolving
slowly, something like a pair of wheels
with one paddle each, and it was occupied by one
person. This person was Arthur Raybold, who
had found the bishop calking the boat, and as
soon as this work was finished, had moodily declared
that he would take a row in her. He had
not yet had a chance to row a boat which was in
a decent condition. He wanted to be alone with
his aspirations. He thought it would be scarcely
wise to attempt to speak to Margery again that
morning; he would give her time for her anger
to cool. She was only a woman, and he knew
women!</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that Raybold,&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;He knows
no more about rowing than a cat, and he&#8217;s floating
sideways down the lake. Good! Now I can
go out and hope to be let alone. I don&#8217;t know
when he will ever get that boat back again.
Perhaps never.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was not a wicked girl, and she did not desire
that the awkward rower might never get
back; but still she did not have that dread of an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
accident which might have come over her had
the occupant of the boat been a brother or any
one she cared very much about. She took a
novel, of which, during her whole stay in camp,
she had read perhaps ten pages, and left the
cabin, this time by the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does your individuality treat you?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Archibald, as Margery approached
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, horribly, so far,&#8221; was the answer; &#8220;but I
think it is going to do better. I shall find some
nice place where I can read and be undisturbed.
I can think of nothing pleasanter such a morning
as this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very much mistaken in your nature,&#8221;
thought Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;if that is the sort of
thing that suits you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; said Margery, not in the least surprised
that she should meet the young guide
within the next three minutes, &#8220;do you know of
some really nice secluded spot where I can sit and
read, and not be bothered? I don&#8217;t mean that
place where you hung the hammock. I don&#8217;t
want to go there again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin was pale, and his voice trembled as he
spoke. &#8220;Miss Dearborn,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I think it is a
wicked and a burning shame that you should be
forced to look for a hiding-place where you may
hope to rest undisturbed if that scoundrel in the
boat out there should happen to fancy to come
ashore. But you needn&#8217;t do it. There is no
necessity for it. Go where you please, sit where
you please, and do what you please, and I will see
to it that you are not disturbed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; exclaimed Margery. &#8220;That
would never do. I know very well that you
could keep him away from me, and I am quite
sure that you would be glad to do it, but there
mustn&#8217;t be anything of that kind. He is Miss
Raybold&#8217;s brother and&mdash;and in a way one of our
camping party, and I don&#8217;t want any disturbances
or quarrels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin&#8217;s breast heaved, and he breathed heavily.
&#8220;I have no doubt you are right,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;of
course you are. But I can tell you this: if I
see that fellow troubling you again I&#8217;ll kill him,
or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin! Martin!&#8221; exclaimed Margery. &#8220;What
do you mean? What makes you talk in this
way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes me?&#8221; he exclaimed, as if it were
impossible to restrain his words. &#8220;My heart
makes me, my soul makes me. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your heart? Your soul?&#8221; interrupted Margery.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment he looked at the astonished girl
in silence, and then he said: &#8220;Miss Dearborn, it&#8217;s
of no use for me to try to hide what I feel. If I
hadn&#8217;t got so angry I might have been able to
keep quiet, but I can&#8217;t do it now. If that man
thinks he loves you, his love is like a grain of
sand compared to mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours?&#8221; cried Margery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Martin, his face pallid and his eyes
sparkling, &#8220;mine. You may think it is an insult
for me to talk this way, but love is love, and it
will spring up where it pleases; and besides, I am
not the common sort of a fellow you may think I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
am. After saying what I have said, I am bound
to say more. I belong to a good family, and am
college bred. I am poor, and I love nature. I
am working to make money to travel and become
a naturalist. I prefer this sort of work because
it takes me into the heart of nature. I am not
ashamed of what I am, I am not ashamed of my
work, and my object in life is a nobler one, I
think, than the practice of the law, or a great
many other things like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery stood and looked at him with wide-open
eyes. &#8220;Do you mean to say,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that
you want to marry me? It would take years and
years for you to become naturalist enough to
support a wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have made no plans,&#8221; he said, quickly, &#8220;I
have no purpose. I did not intend to tell you
now that I love you, but since I have said that, I
will say also that with you to fight for there
could be no doubt about my success. I should
be bound to succeed. It would be impossible for
me to fail. As for the years, I would wait, no
matter how many they should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke with such hot earnestness that Margery
involuntarily drew herself a little away from
him. At this the flush went out of his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Dearborn,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;don&#8217;t
think that I am like that man out there! Don&#8217;t
think that I will persecute you if you don&#8217;t wish
to hear me; that I will follow you about and make
your life miserable. If you say to me that you
do not wish to see me again, you will never see
me again. Say what you please, and you will
find that I am a gentleman.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>She could see that now. She felt sure that if
she told him she did not wish ever to see him
again he would never appear before her. But
what would he do? She was not in the least
afraid of him, but his fierce earnestness frightened
her, not for herself, but for him. Suddenly
a thought struck her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt in the least
that what you have said to me about yourself is
true. You are as good as other people, although
you do happen now to be a guide, and perhaps
after a while you may be very well off; but for all
that you are a guide, and you are in Mr. Sadler&#8217;s
employment, and Mr. Sadler&#8217;s rights and powers
are just like gas escaping from a pipe: they are
everywhere from cellar to garret, so to speak, and
you couldn&#8217;t escape them. It would be a bad,
bad thing for you, Martin, if he were to hear that
you make propositions of the kind you have made
to the ladies that he pays you to take out into the
woods to guide and to protect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin was on the point of a violent expostulation,
but she stopped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I know what you are going to say,&#8221; she
exclaimed, &#8220;but it isn&#8217;t of any use. You are in
his employment, and you are bound to honor and
to respect him; that is the way a guide can show
himself to be a gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose,&#8221; said Martin, quickly, &#8220;that he,
knowing my family as he does, should think I
had done wisely in speaking to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A cloud came over her brow. It annoyed her
that he should thus parry her thrust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can ask him,&#8221; she said, abruptly;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
&#8220;and if he doesn&#8217;t object, you can go to see my
mother, when she gets home, and ask her. And
here comes Mr. Matlack. I think he has been
calling you. Now don&#8217;t say another word, unless
it is about fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Matlack did not come; he stopped and
called, and Martin went to him.</p>
<p>Margery walked languidly towards the woods
and sat down on the projecting root of a large
tree. Then leaning back against the trunk, she
sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a perfectly dreadful thing to be a girl,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;but I am glad I did not speak to him
as I did to Mr. Raybold. I believe he would have
jumped into the lake.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE INDIVIDUALITY OF PETER SADLER</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; said Matlack, sharply, before the
young man had reached him, &#8220;it seems to me
that you think that you have been engaged here
as lady&#8217;s-maid, but there&#8217;s other things to do besides
teaching young women about trees and
fishes. If you think,&#8221; continued Matlack, when
the two had reached the woodland kitchen, &#8220;that
your bein&#8217; a hermit is goin&#8217; to let you throw all
the work on me, you&#8217;re mistaken. There&#8217;s a lot
of potatoes that&#8217;s got to be peeled for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word Martin sat down on the ground
with a pan of potatoes in front of him and began
to work. Had he been a proud crusader setting
forth to fight the Saracens his blood could not
have coursed with greater warmth and force, his
soul could not have more truly spurned the earth
and all the common things upon it. What he
had said to Margery had made him feel ennobled.
If Raybold had that instant appeared before him
with some jeering insult, Martin would have pardoned
him with lofty scorn; and yet he peeled
potatoes, and did it well. But his thoughts were
not upon his work; they were upon the future
which, if he proved himself to be the man he
thought himself to be, might open before him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
When he had finished the potatoes he put the
pan upon a table and stood near by, deep in
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he to himself, &#8220;I should go now.
After what I have said to her I cannot stay here
and live this life before her. I would wait on her
with bended knee at every step, but with love
for her in my soul I cannot wash dishes for other
people. I have spoken, and now I must act; and
the quicker the better. If all goes well I may be
here again, but I shall not come back as a guide.&#8221;
Then a thought of Raybold crossed his mind, but
he put it aside. Even if he stayed here he could
not protect her, for she had shown that she did
not wish him to do it in the only way he could do
it, and he felt sure, too, that any further annoyance
would result in an appeal to Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Matlack, sharply, &#8220;what&#8217;s the
matter with you? Don&#8217;t you intend to move?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Martin, turning quickly, &#8220;I do
intend to move. I am going to leave this camp
just as soon as I can pack my things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where in the name of thunder are you
goin&#8217; to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to Sadler&#8217;s,&#8221; said Martin.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On my own business,&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>Matlack looked at him for a moment suspiciously.
&#8220;Have you got any complaints to make
of me?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Martin, promptly, &#8220;not one; but I
have affairs on hand which will take me off immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before dinner?&#8221; asked Matlack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;before dinner; now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead then,&#8221; said Matlack, putting some
sticks of wood into the stove; &#8220;and tell Sadler
that if he don&#8217;t send me somebody before supper-time
to help about this camp, he&#8217;ll see me. I&#8217;ll
be hanged,&#8221; he said to himself, as he closed the
door of the stove, &#8220;if this isn&#8217;t hermitism with a
vengeance. I wonder who&#8217;ll be the next one to
cut and run; most likely it will be Mrs. Perkenpine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon, warm and dusty, Martin
presented himself before Peter Sadler, who was
smoking his pipe on the little shaded piazza at
the back of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;How in the name of
common-sense did you happen to turn up at this
minute? This is about as queer a thing as I&#8217;ve
known of lately. What did you come for? Sit
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sadler,&#8221; said Martin, &#8220;I have come here
on most important business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lake dry?&#8221; asked Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a matter,&#8221; said Martin, &#8220;which concerns
myself; and if all the lakes in the world were
dry, I would not be able to think about them, so
full is my soul of one thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the Lord Harry,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;let&#8217;s have
it, quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>In a straightforward manner, but with an
ardent vehemence which he could not repress,
Martin stated his business with Peter Sadler. He
told him how he loved Margery, what he had said
to her, and what she had said to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the young man, &#8220;I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
come to ask your permission to address her; but
whether you give it or not I shall go to her
mother and speak to her. I know her address,
and I intend to do everything in an honorable
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Sadler put down his pipe and looked steadfastly
at the young man. &#8220;I wish to Heaven,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;that there was a war goin&#8217; on! I&#8217;d
write a letter to the commander-in-chief and let
you take it to him, and I&#8217;d tell him you was the
bravest man between Hudson Bay and Patagonia.
By George! I can&#8217;t understand it! I
can&#8217;t understand how you could have the cheek,
the unutterable brass, to come here and ask me&mdash;me,
Peter Sadler&mdash;to let you court one of the
ladies in a campin&#8217;-party of mine. And, what&#8217;s
more, I can&#8217;t understand how I can sit here and
hear you tell me that tale without picking up a
chair and knocking you down with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sadler,&#8221; said Martin, rising, &#8220;I have
spoken to you fairly and squarely, and if that&#8217;s
all you&#8217;ve got to say, I will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down!&#8221; roared Peter, bringing his hand
upon the table as if he would drive it&#8217;s legs
through the floor. &#8220;Sit down, and listen to what
I have to say to you. It&#8217;s the strangest thing
that ever happened to me that I am not more
angry with you than I am; but I can&#8217;t understand
it, and I pass it by. Now that you are
seated again, I will make some remarks on my
side. Do you see that?&#8221; said he, picking up a
letter on the table. &#8220;Do you see who it is addressed
to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To me!&#8221; exclaimed Martin, in surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s to you,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;and I wrote it,
and I intended to send it by Bill Hammond this
afternoon. That&#8217;s the reason I was surprised
when I saw you here. But I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to give
it to you; I&#8217;d rather tell you what&#8217;s in it, now
you are here. Before I knew you were the abject
ninnyhammer that you have just told me you
are I had a good opinion of you, and thought that
you were cut out to make a first-class traveller
and explorer&mdash;the sort of a fellow who could
lead a surveying expedition through the wilderness,
or work up new countries and find out what
they are made of and what&#8217;s in them. Only yesterday
I heard of a chance that ought to make
you jump, and this morning I wrote to you about
it. A friend of mine, who&#8217;s roughed it with me
for many a day, is goin&#8217; to take an expedition
down into New Mexico in the interests of a railroad
and minin&#8217; company. They want to know
everything about the country&mdash;the game, fish,
trees, and plants, as well as the minerals&mdash;and it
struck me that if you are not just the kind of
man they want you could make yourself so in
a very short time. They&#8217;d pay you well enough,
and you&#8217;d have a chance to dip into natural history,
and all that sort of thing, that you had no
reason to expect for a dozen years to come, if it
ever came. If such a chance had been offered
to me at your age I wouldn&#8217;t have changed lots
with a king. All you&#8217;ve got to do is to pack
up and be off. The party starts from New York
in just three days; I&#8217;ll give you a letter to
Joe Hendricks, and that&#8217;ll be all you want. He
knows me well enough to take you without a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
word. If you haven&#8217;t got money enough saved
to fit yourself out for the trip I&#8217;ll lend you some,
and you can pay me back when they pay you.
You can take the train this afternoon and maybe
you can see Hendricks to-night. So pack up
what you want and leave what you don&#8217;t want,
and I&#8217;ll take care of it. I&#8217;ll write to Hendricks
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many times did the face of Martin flush and
pale as he listened. A vision of Paradise had
been opened before him, but he felt that he must
shut his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sadler,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are very kind. You
offer me a great thing&mdash;a thing which two weeks
ago I should have accepted in the twinkling of an
eye, and would have thanked you for all the rest
of my life; but I cannot take it now. With all
my heart I love a woman; I have told her so,
and I am now going on the path she told me to
take. I cannot turn aside from that for any prospects
in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Sadler&#8217;s face grew red, and then it grew
black, and then it turned red again, and finally
resumed its ordinary brown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin Sanders,&#8221; said he, speaking quietly,
but with one hand fastened upon the arm of his
chair with a grasp which a horse could not have
loosened, &#8220;if you are cowardly enough and small
enough and paltry enough to go to a girl who is
living in peace and comfort and ask her to marry
you, when you know perfectly well that for years
to come you could not give her a decent roof over
her head, and that if her family wanted her to
live like a Christian they would have to give her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
the money to do it with; and if you are fool
enough not to know that when she sent you first
to me and then to her mother she was tryin&#8217; to
get rid of you without hurtin&#8217; your feelin&#8217;s, why,
then, I want you to get out of my sight, and the
quicker the better. But if you are not so low
down as that, go to your room and pack up your
bag. The coach will start for the train at three
o&#8217;clock, and it is now nearly half-past two; that
will just give me time to write to Hendricks.
Go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin rose. Whatever happened afterwards,
he must go now. It seemed to him as if the
whole world had suddenly grown colder; as if
he had been floating in a fog and had neared an
iceberg. Could it be possible that she had spoken,
as she had spoken, simply to get rid of him? He
could not believe it. No one with such honest
eyes could speak in that way; and yet he did not
know what to believe.</p>
<p>In any case, he would go away in the coach.
He had spoken to Sadler, and now, whether he
spoke to any one else or not, the sooner he left
the better.</p>
<p>When he came to take the coach, Peter Sadler,
who had rolled himself to the front of the house,
handed him the letter he had written.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are made of the right kind of
stuff,&#8221; he said, &#8220;although you&#8217;ve got a little
mouldy by bein&#8217; lazy out there in the woods,
but you&#8217;re all right now; and what you&#8217;ve got
to do is to go ahead with a will, and, take my
word for it, you&#8217;ll come out on top. Do you
want any money? No? Very well, then, goodbye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
You needn&#8217;t trouble yourself to write to me,
I&#8217;ll hear about you from Hendricks; and I&#8217;d
rather know what he thinks about you than
what you think about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How little you know,&#8221; thought Martin, as he
entered the coach, &#8220;what I am or what I think
about myself. As if my purpose could be changed
by words of yours!&#8221; And he smiled a smile
which would have done justice to Arthur Raybold.
The chill had gone out of him; he was
warm again.</p>
<p>On the train he read the letter to Hendricks
which Peter Sadler had given to him unsealed.
It was a long letter, and he read it twice. Then
he sat and gazed out of the window at the flying
scenery for nearly half an hour, after which he
read the letter again. Then he folded it up and
put it into his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she had given me the slightest reason to
hope,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;how easy it would be
to tear this letter into scraps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now an idea came into his mind. If he could
see her mother quickly, and if she should ignore
his honorable intentions and refuse to give him
the opportunity to prove that he was worthy of a
thought from her and her daughter, then it might
not be too late to fall back on Peter Sadler&#8217;s letter.
But he shook his head; that would be dishonorable
and unworthy of him.</p>
<p>He shut his eyes; he could not bear to look at
the brightness of the world outside the window
of the car. Under his closed lids there came to
him visions, sometimes of Margery and sometimes
of the forests of New Mexico. Sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
the visions were wavering, uncertain, and transitory,
and again they were strong and vivid&mdash;so
plain to him that he could almost hear the
leaves rustle as some wild creature turned a
startled look upon him.</p>
<p>That night he delivered his letter to Mr. Hendricks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A TRANQUILLIZING BREEZE AND A HOT WIND</h3>
</div>

<p>After Martin had left her, Margery sat on the
root of the tree until Mr. Clyde came up and said
he had been wondering what had become of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been wondering that, myself,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;At least, I have been wondering what
is going to become of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you intend to be a hermit?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it is possible,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;There is no one who is
better satisfied to be alone, and who can make
herself happier all by herself, and who, in all sorts
of ways, can get along better without other people
than I can, and yet other people are continually
interfering with me, and I cannot get away
from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clyde smiled. &#8220;That is a pretty plain hint,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I suppose I might as well take it, and
go off to some hermitage of my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense!&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so
awfully quick in coming to conclusions. I do feel
worried and troubled and bothered, and I want
some one to talk to; not about things which
worry me, of course, but about common, ordinary
things, that will make me forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>A slight shade came over the face of Mr. Clyde,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
and he seated himself on the ground near Margery.
&#8220;It is a shame,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that you should
be worried. What is it in this peaceable, beautiful
forest troubles you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of a paradise without
snakes?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;The very beauty of it
makes them come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never yet known any paradise at all,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;But can&#8217;t you tell me what it is
that troubles you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery looked at him with her clear, large
eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you will promise
not to do a single thing without my permission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise that,&#8221; said Clyde, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am troubled by people making love to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People!&#8221; exclaimed Clyde, with a puzzled air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Your cousin is one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have supposed that; but who on
earth can be the other one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Martin,&#8221; said Margery.</p>
<p>For a moment Mr. Clyde did not seem to understand,
and then he exclaimed: &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean the young man who cuts wood and helps
Matlack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;And you need
not shut your jaw hard and grit your teeth that
way. That is exactly what he did when he found
out about Mr. Raybold. It is of no use to get
angry, for you can&#8217;t do anything without my permission;
and, besides, I tell you that if I were
condemned by a court to be made love to, I would
much rather have Martin make it than Mr. Raybold.
Martin is a good deal more than a guide;
he has a good education, and would not be here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
if it were not for his love of nature. He is going
to make nature his object in life, and there is
something noble in that; a great deal better than
trying to strut about on the stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And those two have really been making love
to you?&#8221; asked Clyde.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, really,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You never saw
people more in earnest in all your life. As for
Mr. Raybold, he was as earnest as a cat after a
bird. He made me furiously angry. Martin was
different. He is just as earnest, but he is more
of a gentleman; and when I told him what I
wanted him to do, he said he would do it. But
there is no use in telling your cousin what I want
him to do. He is determined to persecute me
and make me miserable, and there is no way
of stopping it, except by making a quarrel between
him and Uncle Archibald. It is a shame!&#8221;
she went on, &#8220;Who could have thought that two
people would have turned up to disturb me in
this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; said Mr. Clyde, and although he
called her by her Christian name she took no
notice of it, &#8220;you think you have too many
lovers: but you are mistaken. You have not
enough; you ought to have three.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, quickly, &#8220;and I want to be the
third.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so make matters three times as bad as
they were at first?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said he. &#8220;When you have chosen
one of them, he could easily keep away the two
others.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;that if I were
to agree to have three, and then, if I were to ask
you to do it, you would go away quietly with one
of the others and leave me in peace with the
third one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Clyde half smiled, but instantly grew serious
again, and a flush came on his face. &#8220;Margery,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I cannot bear trifling any more
about this. No matter what anybody has said to
you, whether it is any one in this camp or any
one out of it, there is not a man in this world
who&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Clyde,&#8221; interrupted Margery, &#8220;you
must not sit there and speak to me in such an
excited way. If any one should see us they would
think we were quarrelling. Let us go down to
the lake; the air from the water is cool and
soothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they walked from under the shade of
the tree, and so wended their way that it brought
them to a mass of shrubbery which edged the
water a little distance down the lake. On the
other side of this shrubbery was a pretty bank,
which they had seen before.</p>
<p>&#8220;It always tranquillizes me,&#8221; said Margery, as
they stood side by side on the bank, &#8220;to look out
over the water. Doesn&#8217;t it have that effect on
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; exclaimed Clyde. &#8220;It does not tranquillize
me a bit. Nothing could tranquillize me
at a moment like this. Margery, I want you to
know that I love you. I did not intend to tell
you so soon, but what you have said makes it
necessary. I have loved you ever since I met
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
you at Peter Sadler&#8217;s, and, no matter what you
say about it, I shall love you to the end of my
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I should send you away with one of
the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; no matter what you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be wrong,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter. Right or wrong, I&#8217;d do
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery gave him a glance from which it
would have been impossible to eliminate all signs
of admiration. &#8220;And if I were to arrange it
otherwise,&#8221; she said, &#8220;would you undertake to
keep the others away?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer to this question, but in a
minute afterwards Clyde exclaimed: &#8220;Do you
think any one would dare to come near you if
they saw you now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said Margery, raising her head from
his shoulder and looking up into his sparkling
eyes. &#8220;Really, Harrison, you ought not to speak
in such a loud voice. If Aunt Harriet were to
hear you she might dare to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery was late to dinner, although the horn
was blown three times.</p>
<p>Much to the surprise of his wife, Mr. Archibald
returned to camp about an hour before dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is this?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t the
fishing good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had a disagreeable experience,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I will tell you about it. I was fishing in a
little cove some distance down the lake and having
good sport, when I heard a thumping, and
looking around I saw Raybold in a boat rowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
towards me. I suppose he thought he was rowing,
but he was really floating with the current;
but as he neared me he suddenly pulled his boat
towards me with such recklessness that I was
afraid he would run into me. I considered his
rowing into the cove to be a piece of bad manners,
for of course it would spoil my fishing, but
I had no idea he actually intended to lay alongside
of me. This he did, however, and so awkwardly
that his boat struck mine with such force
that it half tipped it over. Then he lay hold of
my gunwale, and said he had something to say
to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was as angry as if a man in the street had
knocked my hat down over my eyes and said that
he did so in order to call my attention to a subscription
paper. But this indignation was nothing
to what I felt when the fellow began to
speak. I cannot repeat his words, but he stated
his object at once, and said that as this was a
good opportunity to speak to me alone, he wished
to ask me to remove what he called the utterly
useless embargo which I had placed upon him in
regard to Margery. He said it was useless because
he could not be expected to give up his
hopes and his plans simply because I objected to
them; and he went on to say that if I understood
him fully, and if Margery understood him,
he did not believe that either of us would object.
And then he actually asked me to use my influence
with her to make her listen to him. From
what he said, I am sure he has been speaking to
her. I did not let him finish, but turned and
blazed at him in words as strong as would come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
to me. I ordered him never to speak to me again
or show himself in my camp, and told him that if
he did either of these things he would do them at
his peril; and then, for fear he might say something
which would make me lose control of myself,
I jerked up my anchor and rowed away from
him. I didn&#8217;t feel like fishing any more, and so
I came back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His behavior is shameful,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald.
&#8220;And what is more, it is ridiculous, for
Margery would not look at him. What sort of a
man does he think you are, to suppose that you
would give your permission to any one, no matter
who he might be, to offer marriage to a young
lady in your charge? But what are you going to
do about it? I think it very likely he will come
to this camp, and he may speak to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case I shall have him driven out,&#8221;
said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;as if he were a drunken
vagabond. Personally I shall have nothing to do
with him, but I shall order my guides to eject
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope that may not be necessary,&#8221; said his
wife. &#8220;It would make bad feeling, and deeply
wound his sister, for it would be the same thing
as putting her out. She talks too much, to be
sure, but she is a lady, and has treated us all
very courteously. I wish we could get through
the rest of our stay here without any disturbance
or bad feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish so too, with all my heart,&#8221; said her
husband. &#8220;And the only thing necessary to that
end is that that ass Raybold shall keep out of
my sight.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>It was about two o&#8217;clock that afternoon, and
Mrs. Archibald, under her tree, her basket of
stockings all darned and her novel at its culminating
point of interest, was the only visible occupant
of Camp Rob, when Corona Raybold
came walking towards her, an obvious purpose in
her handsome face, which was somewhat flushed
by exercise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think,&#8221; she said, as soon as she was
near enough for Mrs. Archibald to hear her,
&#8220;that the true purpose and intention of our plan
is properly understood by all of the party. I
think, after some explanation, everything will go
well, but I have been endeavoring for the last half-hour
to find Mrs. Perkenpine, and have utterly
failed. I am very hungry, but I can discover
nothing to eat. All our stores appear to be absolutely
raw, or in some intermediate state of crudity.
I intend to order some provisions in cans
or boxes which will be at all times available, but
I have not done so yet, and so I have come over
to speak to you about the matter. Did your
guides prepare your dinner as usual?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;A hermit life
seems to make no difference with Mr. Matlack.
We become associates at meal-times, but, as you
see, we have separated again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must instil into Mrs. Perkenpine&#8217;s mind,&#8221;
said Corona, &#8220;that, in order thoroughly to act
out her own nature, she must cook and do other
things of a domestic character. Of course she
will do those things in her own way; that is to
be expected; but she must do them. It is impossible
to imagine a woman of her class whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
soul is not set more or less upon domestic affairs.
I will instance Mr. Matlack. His nature belongs
to the woods and the out-of-door world, and that
nature prompts him to cook what he shoots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald laughed. &#8220;I think his nature
is a very good one,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I will go with
you to find him and see if he cannot give you a
luncheon, if not a dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said Corona; &#8220;but
indeed I do not wish to trouble you. I will go to
him myself. You are very kind, but it is not in
the least degree necessary for you to accompany
me. A cup of tea and some little trifle is all I
shall ask him for.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Mrs. Archibald hesitated, and
then she said, &#8220;As we are hermits, I suppose we
must not keep together any more than we can
help, and so I will let you go alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corona found Phil Matlack by his kitchen tent,
busily engaged in rubbing the inside of a large
kettle. He was not in a good humor. The departure
of Martin had thrown all the work of his
camp upon him, and now the appearance of a
person from another camp requesting to be fed
aroused him to absolute anger. He did not scold,
for it would have been impossible to look at that
beautiful and imperturbable face and say hard
words to it. He did not refuse the cup of tea
or the bread-and-butter for which he was asked,
and he even added some cold meat; but he indignantly
made up his mind that he would stand no
more of this nonsense, and that if necessary he
would go to Sadler and throw up the job. He
had not engaged to cook for three camps.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>Miss Raybold did not appear to notice his state
of mind, and ate heartily. She thought it was
fortunate that he happened to have the kettle on
the stove, and she asked him how he liked the
hermit life&mdash;the living for himself alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t tried it,&#8221; he answered, curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Corona, &#8220;you have had to
live too much for other people; but it is too soon
to expect our plan to run smoothly. In a short
time, however, we shall be better able to know
our own natures and show them to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can do that,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and I am goin&#8217;
to, precious soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt of it,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;And
now can you tell me where Mr. Archibald has
gone? I did not see him this morning, and there
are some matters I wish to speak to him about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, miss,&#8221; said Matlack, promptly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know where he is. He&#8217;s a real hermit. He&#8217;s off
by himself, most likely miles away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corona reflected. &#8220;Mr.&mdash;the bishop? Have
you seen him? He may be able to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The guide grinned grimly. He had seen the
man of muscle&mdash;not fat&mdash;conversing that morning
with Corona, and an hour afterwards he had
seen him, not in the same place, but in the same
companionship, and it gave him a certain pleasure
to know that the man who could heave rocks
and break young trees could not relieve himself
from the thralls of the lady of the flowing
speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bishop?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know
where he went to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He left me,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;because he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
obliged to go to prepare dinner for my brother
and Mr. Clyde; but he is not in Camp Roy now,
for I went there to look for Mrs. Perkenpine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the wicked Matlack, pointing to
the spot where, not long before, Margery had
found a tranquillizing breeze, &#8220;I saw him going
along with a book a little while ago, and I think
he went down to the shore, just beyond that
clump of bushes over there. He seems to be a
man who likes readin&#8217;, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing for
a hermit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Miss Raybold, rising. &#8220;I
do not care for anything more. You are very
kind, and I am quite sure I shall not have to
trouble you again. To-morrow everything will
be running smoothly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matlack looked at her as she quietly walked
away. &#8220;She&#8217;s a pretty sort of a hermit,&#8221; he said
to himself. &#8220;If she really had to live by herself
she&#8217;d cut out a wooden man and talk to it all day.
It won&#8217;t be long before she accidentally stumbles
over that big fellow with his book.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>MRS. PERKENPINE FINDS OUT THINGS ABOUT HERSELF</h3>
</div>

<p>The mind of the guide was comforted and relieved
that he had got the better of the bishop in
one way, although he could not do it in another.
But he did not relinquish his purpose of putting
an end to the nonsense which made him do the
work of other people, and as soon as he had set
his kitchen in order he started out to find Mrs.
Perkenpine. A certain amount of nonsense from
the people in camp might have to be endured,
but nonsense from Mrs. Perkenpine was something
about which Peter Sadler would have a
word to say.</p>
<p>Matlack was a good hunter. He could follow
all sorts of tracks&mdash;rabbit tracks, bird tracks,
deer tracks, and the tracks of big ungainly shoes&mdash;and
in less than half an hour he had reached a
cluster of moss-covered rocks lying some distance
back in the woods, and approached by the bed of
a now dry stream. Sitting on one of these rocks,
her back against a tree, her straw hat lying beside
her, and her dishevelled hair hanging about
her shoulders, was Mrs. Perkenpine, reading a
newspaper. At the sound of his footsteps she
looked up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be bound!&#8221; she said. &#8220;If I&#8217;d crawl
into a fox-hole I expect you&#8217;d come and sniff in
after me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matlack stood and looked at her for a moment.
He could not help smiling at the uncomfortable
manner in which she was trying to make herself
comfortable on those rough rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is, Mrs. Perkenpine,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll get yourself into the worst kind of a
hole if you go off this way, leavin&#8217; everything at
sixes and sevens behind you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my nater,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I&#8217;m findin&#8217; it out
and gittin&#8217; it ready to show to other people.
You&#8217;re the fust one that&#8217;s seed it. How do you
like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it at all,&#8221; said the guide, &#8220;and I
have just come to tell you that if you don&#8217;t go
back to your tent and cook supper to-night and
attend to your business, I&#8217;ll walk over to Sadler&#8217;s,
and tell Peter to send some one in your place.
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; over there anyway, if he don&#8217;t send a
man to take Martin&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Sadler!&#8221; ejaculated Mrs. Perkenpine,
letting her tumbled newspaper fall into her lap.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a man that knows his own nater, and lets
other people see it. He lives his own life, if anybody
does. He&#8217;s individdle down to the heels,
and just look at him! He&#8217;s the same as a king.
I tell you, Phil Matlack, that the more I knows
myself, just me, the more I&#8217;m tickled. It seems
like scootin&#8217; round in the woods, findin&#8217; all sorts
of funny hoppin&#8217; things and flowers that you
never seed before. Why, it &#8217;ain&#8217;t been a whole
day since I begun knowin&#8217; myself, and I&#8217;ve found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
out lots. I used to think that I liked to cook and
clean up, but I don&#8217;t; I hate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matlack smiled, and taking out his pipe, he
lighted it and sat down on a rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you are the most
out and out hermit of the whole lot; but it won&#8217;t
do, and if you don&#8217;t get over your objections to
cookin&#8217; you&#8217;ll have to walk out of these woods to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkenpine sat and looked at her companion
a few moments without giving any apparent
heed to his remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t only findin&#8217; out
what you be yourself, but it&#8217;s lettin&#8217; other people
see what you be. If you didn&#8217;t do that it would
be like a pot a-b&#8217;ilin&#8217; out in the middle of a prairie,
with nobody nearer nor a hundred miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be the same as if it hadn&#8217;t b&#8217;iled,&#8221;
remarked Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jest it,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and so I ain&#8217;t sorry
you come along, Phil, so&#8217;s I can tell you some
things I&#8217;ve found out about myself. One of them
is that I like to lie flat on my back and look up
at the leaves of the trees and think about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; asked Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Just as soon
as I begin to look at them wrigglin&#8217; in the wind,
and I am beginnin&#8217; to wonder what it is I think
about them, I go slam bang to sleep, and when I
wake up and try to think again what it is I think,
off I go again. But I like it. If I don&#8217;t know
what it is I think, I ought to know that I don&#8217;t
know it. That&#8217;s what I call bein&#8217; really and truly
a hermick.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What else did you find out?&#8221; inquired Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found out,&#8221; she answered, with animation,
&#8220;that I admire to read anecdotes. I didn&#8217;t know
I cared a pin for anecdotes until I took to hermickin&#8217;.
Now here&#8217;s this paper; it came &#8217;round
the cheese, and it&#8217;s got a good many anecdotes
scattered about in it. Let me read one of them
to you. It&#8217;s about a man who made his will and
afterwards was a-drivin&#8217; a horse along a road, and
the horse got skeered and ran over his executor,
who was takin&#8217; a walk. Then he sung out, &#8216;Oh,
bless my soul!&#8217; says he. But I&#8217;ll read you the
rest if I can find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about the anecdote,&#8221; said Matlack,
who knew very well that it would take Mrs.
Perkenpine half an hour to spell out twenty lines
in a newspaper. &#8220;What I want to know is if you
found out anything about yourself that&#8217;s likely to
give you a boost in the direction of that cookin&#8217;-stove
of yourn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Perkenpine was a woman whose remarks
did not depend upon the remarks of others.
&#8220;Phil Matlack,&#8221; said she, gazing fixedly at his
pipe, &#8220;if I had a man I&#8217;d let him smoke just as
much as he pleased and just where he pleased.
He could smoke afore he got up, and he could
smoke at his meals, and he could smoke after he
went to bed, and, if he fancied that sort of thing,
he could smoke at family prayers; it wouldn&#8217;t
make no difference to me, and I wouldn&#8217;t say a
word to him agin&#8217; it. If that was his individdlety,
I&#8217;d say viddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how about everything else?&#8221; asked Matlack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
&#8220;Would you tell him to cook his own victuals
and mend his clothes accordin&#8217; to his own
nater?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said she, striking with her expansive
hand the newspaper in her lap&mdash;&#8220;no, sir. I&#8217;d get
up early in the mornin&#8217;, and cook and wash and
bake and scour. I&#8217;d skin the things he shot, and
clean his fish, and dig bait if he wanted it. I&#8217;d
tramp into the woods after him, and carry the
gun and the victuals and fishin&#8217;-poles, and I&#8217;d set
traps and row a boat and build fires, and let him
go along and work out his own nater smokin&#8217; or
in any other way he was born to. That&#8217;s the biggest
thing I&#8217;ve found out about myself. I never
knowed, until I began, this mornin&#8217;, explorin&#8217; of
my own nater, what a powerful hard thing it is,
when I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; of my own individdlety, to keep
somebody else&#8217;s individdlety from poppin&#8217; up in
front of it, and so says I to myself, &#8216;If I can think
of both them individdleties at the same time it
will suit me fust-rate.&#8217; And when you come
along I thought I&#8217;d let you know what sort of a
nater I&#8217;ve got, for it ain&#8217;t likely you&#8217;d ever find it
out for yourself. And now that we&#8217;re in that
business&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried Matlack, springing to his feet.
&#8220;There is somebody callin&#8217; me. Who&#8217;s there?&#8221;
he shouted, stepping out into the bed of the
stream.</p>
<p>A call was now heard, and in a few moments
the bishop appeared some distance below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Matlack,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s a man at your
camp inquiring for you. He came from Sadler&#8217;s,
and I&#8217;ve been looking high and low for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A man from Sadler&#8217;s,&#8221; said Matlack, turning
to Mrs. Perkenpine, &#8220;and I must be off to see
him. Remember what I told you about the supper.&#8221;
And so saying, he walked rapidly away.</p>
<p>Out in the open Matlack found the bishop.
&#8220;Obliged to you for lookin&#8217; me up,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s
a pity to give you so much trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t mention it!&#8221; exclaimed the bishop.
&#8220;You cannot understand, perhaps, not knowing
the circumstances, but I assure you I never was
more obliged to any one than to that man who
wants to see you and couldn&#8217;t find you. There
was no one else to look for you, and I simply had
to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not goin&#8217; to walk back to camp?&#8221; inquired
Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the bishop, &#8220;now that I am here,
I think I will go up the lake and try to find a very
secluded spot in the shade and take a nap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guide smiled as he walked away. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
understand!&#8221; said he. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got the boot on
the wrong leg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arrived at his tent, Matlack found Bill Hammond,
a young man in Sadler&#8217;s service, who informed
him that that burly individual had sent
Martin away in the stage-coach, and had ordered
him to come and take his place.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Matlack. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re as
good as he was, and so you can settle down to
work. By-the-way, do you know that we are all
hermits here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hermits?&#8221; said the other. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, hermits,&#8221; said Matlack, &#8220;is individ&#8217;als
who get up early in the mornin&#8217; and attend to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
their own business just as hard as they can, without
lookin&#8217; to the right or left, until it&#8217;s time to
go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man looked at him in some surprise.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing so very uncommon in
that,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the guide, &#8220;perhaps there ain&#8217;t.
But as you might hear them talkin&#8217; about hermits
here, I thought I&#8217;d tell you just what sort of
things they are.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>A DISSOLVING AUDIENCE</h3>
</div>

<p>When a strange young man assisted Matlack
at the supper-table that evening, Mr. Archibald
asked what had become of Martin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Sadler has sent him away,&#8221; answered
the guide. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where he sent him or
what he sent him for. But he&#8217;s a young man
who&#8217;s above this sort of business, and so I suppose
he&#8217;s gone off to take up something that&#8217;s
more elevated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;for I liked
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald smiled. &#8220;This business of insisting
upon our own individualities,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;seems to have worked very promptly in his
case. I suppose he found out he was fitted for
something better than a guide, and immediately
went off to get that better thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the size of it,&#8221; said Matlack.</p>
<p>Margery said nothing. Her heart sank. She
could not help feeling that what she had said to
the young man had been the cause of his sudden
departure. Could he have done such a thing, she
thought, as really to go and ask Mr. Sadler, and,
having found he did not mind, could he have gone
to see her mother? Her appetite for her supper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
departed, and she soon rose and strolled away,
and as she strolled the thought came again to
her that it was a truly dreadful thing to be a
girl.</p>
<p>Having received no orders to the contrary,
Matlack, with his new assistant, built and lighted
the camp-fire. Some of the hermits took this as
a matter of course, and some were a little surprised,
but one by one they approached; the
evening air was beginning to be cool, and the
vicinity of the fire was undoubtedly the pleasantest
place in camp. Soon they were all assembled
but one, and Mrs. Archibald breathed freer when
she found that Arthur Raybold was not there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted,&#8221; said Corona, as soon as she
took her usual seat, which was a camp-chair, &#8220;to
see you all gather about the fire. I was afraid
that some of you might think that because we
are hermits we must keep away from each other
all the time. But we must remember that we are
associate hermits, and so should come together
occasionally. I was going to say something to
the effect that some of us may have misunderstood
the true manner and intent of the assertions
of our individualities, but I do not now believe
that this is necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean by all that,&#8221; said Mrs. Perkenpine,
&#8220;that I cooked the supper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Raybold, turning upon her
guide with a pleasant smile, &#8220;that is what I referred
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mrs. Perkenpine, &#8220;I was told that
if I didn&#8217;t cook I&#8217;d be bounced. It isn&#8217;t my individdlety
to cook for outsiders, but it isn&#8217;t my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
individdlety to be bounced, nuther, so I cooked.
Is that bein&#8217; a hermick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have it,&#8221; cried Mr. Archibald, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
not only found out what you are, but what you
have to be. Your knowledge of yourself is perfect.
And now,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;isn&#8217;t there somebody
who can tell us a story? When we are sitting
around a camp-fire, there is nothing better
than stories. Bishop, I dare say you have heard
a good many in the course of your life. Don&#8217;t
you feel like giving us one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Corona, &#8220;that by the aid of
stories it is possible to get a very good idea of
ourselves. For instance, if some one were to tell
a good historical story, and any one of us should
find himself or herself greatly interested in it,
then that person might discover, on subsequent
reflection, some phase of his or her intellect
which he or she might not have before noticed.
On the other hand, if it should be a love story,
and some of us could not bear to hear it, then
we might also find out something about ourselves
of which we had been ignorant. But I
really think that, before making any tests of this
sort, we should continue the discussion of what
is at present the main object of our lives&mdash;self-knowledge
and self-assertion. In other words,
the emancipation of the individual. As I have
said before, and as we all know, there never was
a better opportunity offered a group of people of
mature minds to subject themselves, free of outside
influences, to a thorough mental inquisition,
and then to exhibit the results of their self-examinations
to appreciative companions. This last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
is very important. If we do not announce to
others what we are, it is of scarcely any use to be
anything. I mean this, of course, in a limited
sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harriet,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, abruptly, &#8220;do
you remember where I left my pipe? I do not
like this cigar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the shelf by the door of the cabin,&#8221; she
replied. &#8220;I saw it as I came out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her husband immediately rose and left the fire.
Corona paused in her discourse to wait until Mr.
Archibald came back; but then, as if she did not
wish to lose the floor, she turned towards the
bishop, who sat at a little distance from her, and
addressed herself to him, with the idea of making
some collateral remarks on what she had already
said, in order to fill up the time until Mr. Archibald
should return.</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald thought that her husband had
been a little uncivil; but almost immediately
after he had gone, she, too, jumped up, and, without
making any excuse whatever, hurried after
him.</p>
<p>The reason for this sudden movement was that
Mrs. Archibald had seen some one approaching
from the direction of Camp Roy. She instantly
recognized this person as Arthur Raybold, and
felt sure that, unwilling to stay longer by himself,
he was coming to the camp-fire, and if her
husband should see him, she knew there would be
trouble. What sort of trouble or how far it might
extend she did not try to imagine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hector,&#8221; she said, as soon as she was near
enough for him to hear her, &#8220;don&#8217;t go after the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
pipe; let us take a moonlight walk along the
shore. I believe it is full moon to-night, and we
have not had a walk of that sort for ever so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said her husband, turning to her.
&#8220;I shall be delighted. I don&#8217;t care for the pipe,
and the cigar would have been good enough if it
had not been for the sermon. That would spoil
any pleasure. I can&#8217;t stand that young woman,
Harriet; I positively cannot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, let us walk away and forget her,&#8221;
said his wife. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder she annoys you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were only the young woman,&#8221; thought
Mrs. Archibald, as the two strolled away beneath
the light of the moon, &#8220;we might manage it.
But her brother!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the next indication of a pause in Corona&#8217;s
discourse the bishop suddenly stood on his feet. &#8220;I
wonder,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if there is anything the matter
with Mrs. Archibald? I will step over to her
cabin to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said Corona, rising with great
promptness, &#8220;I hope it is nothing serious. I
will go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery was not a rude girl, but she could not
help a little laugh, which she subdued as much
as possible; Mr. Clyde, who was sitting near her,
laughed also.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing on earth the matter with
Aunt Harriet,&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t go
into the cabin; I saw them walking away down
the shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like to walk that way?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;I think their example is a very good
one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is capital,&#8221; said Margery, jumping up,
&#8220;and let&#8217;s get away quickly before she comes
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>They hurried away, but they did not extend
their walk down the lake shore even as far as
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald had already gone. When
they came to the bit of beach behind the clump
of trees where the bishop had retired that afternoon
to read, they stopped and sat down to watch
the moonlight on the water.</p>
<p>Matlack and Mrs. Perkenpine were now the
only persons at the camp-fire, for Bill Hammond,
as was his custom, had promptly gone to bed as
soon as his work was done. If Arthur Raybold
had intended to come to the camp-fire, he had
changed his mind, for he now stood near his
sister&#8217;s tent, apparently awaiting the approach
of Corona and the bishop, who had not found
the Archibalds, and who were now walking together
in what might have been supposed, by
people who did not know the lady, to be an
earnest dialogue.</p>
<p>Mr. Matlack was seated on his log, and he
smoked, while Mrs. Perkenpine sat on the ground,
her head thrown back and her arms hugging her
knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that there moon looks to me
like an oyster with a candle behind it, and as
smooth and slippery as if I could jest swallow it
down. You may think it is queer for me to think
such things as that, Phil, but since I&#8217;ve come to
know myself jest as I am, me, I&#8217;ve found out
feelin&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Perkenpine,&#8221; said Matlack, knocking the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
ashes out of his pipe, &#8220;there&#8217;s a good many things
besides moons that I can&#8217;t swallow, and if it&#8217;s all
the same to you, I&#8217;ll go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she exclaimed, looking after him, &#8220;his
individdlety is the snapshortest I ever did see!
I don&#8217;t believe he wants to know hisself. If he
did, I&#8217;m dead sure I could help him. He never
goes out to run a camp without somebody to help
him, and yet he&#8217;s so everlastin&#8217; blind he can&#8217;t see
the very best person there is to help him, and she
a-plumpin&#8217; herself square in front of him every
time she gits a chance.&#8221; With that reflection
she rose and walked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Harriet,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, when
he and his wife had returned from their walk and
were about to enter the cabin, &#8220;something must
be done to enable us to spend the rest of our
time here in peace. This is our camp, and we
want it for ourselves. If a good companionable
fellow like the bishop or that young Clyde happens
along, it is all very well, but we do not want
all sorts of people forcing themselves upon us,
and I will not submit to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we ought not to do that,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;but I hope that whatever you do, it will be
something as pleasant as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will try to avoid any unpleasantness,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;and I hope I may do so, but&mdash;&mdash; By-the-way,
where is Margery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she must be in bed,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald;
then stepping inside, she called, &#8220;Margery,
are you there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunt Harriet,&#8221; replied Margery, &#8220;I am
here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She must have found it dreadfully stupid,
poor girl!&#8221; said Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>The lights were all out in the Archibalds&#8217;
cabin, and still Miss Raybold and the bishop
walked up and down the open space at the
farther end of the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Corona!&#8221; exclaimed her brother, suddenly appearing
before them, &#8220;I have told you over and
over again that I wish to speak to you. Are you
never going to stop that everlasting preaching
and give me a chance to talk to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arthur!&#8221; she exclaimed, sharply, &#8220;I wish you
would not interrupt me in this way. I had just
begun to say&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear Miss Raybold,&#8221; cried the bishop,
&#8220;do not let me prevent you from speaking to
your brother. Indeed, it is growing late, and I
will not trespass longer on your time. Good-night,&#8221;
and with a bow he was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now just see what you have done!&#8221; said Corona,
her eye-glasses brighter than the moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is time he was going,&#8221; said her brother.
&#8220;I have something very important to say to
you. I want your good offices in an affair more
worthy of your thoughts than anything else at
this moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever it is,&#8221; she said, turning away from
him, &#8220;I do not want to hear it now&mdash;not a word
of it. You have displeased me, Arthur, and I am
going to my tent.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>A MOONLIGHT INTERVIEW</h3>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Archibald retired to her cabin, but she
did not feel in the least like going to bed. Her
husband had long been asleep in his cot, and she
still sat by the side of the little window looking
out upon the moon-lighted scene; but the beauty
of the night, if she noticed it at all, gave her no
pleasure. Her mind was harassed and troubled
by many things, chief among which was her husband&#8217;s
unfinished sentence in which he had said
that he would try to avoid any unpleasantness,
but at the same time had intimated that if the
unpleasant thing were forced upon him he was
ready to meet it.</p>
<p>Now, reason as she would, Mrs. Archibald could
not banish from her mind the belief that Arthur
Raybold would come to their camp some time
during the next day. In fact, not having heard
otherwise, she supposed he had come to the camp-fire
that night. She was filled with anger and
contempt for the young man who was determined
to force himself on their party in this outrageous
manner, and considered it shameful that their
peaceful life in these woods had been so wickedly
disturbed. No wonder she did not want to sleep;
no wonder she sat at the window thinking and
thinking.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Presently she saw some one walking over the
open space towards the cabin, and she could not
fail to recognize the figure with the long stride,
the folded arms, and the bowed head. He passed
the window and then he turned and repassed it,
then he turned and walked by again, this time a
little nearer than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is too much!&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald.
&#8220;The next thing he will be tapping at her window.
I will go out and speak my mind to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opening the door very softly, and without even
stopping to throw a shawl over her head and
shoulders, Mrs. Archibald stepped outside into
the night. Raybold was now at a little distance
from the cabin, in the direction of Camp Roy,
and was just about to turn when she hurried up
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Raybold,&#8221; she said, speaking low and
rapidly, &#8220;if you possessed a spark of gentlemanly
feeling you would be ashamed to come into this
camp when you have been ordered out of it. My
husband has told you he does not want you here,
and now I tell you that I do not want you here.
It pains me to be obliged to speak to any one in
this manner, but it is plain that no other sort of
speech will affect you. Now, sir, I know your
object, and I will not have you wandering up and
down here in front of our cabin. I wish you to
go to your own camp, and that immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raybold stood and listened to her without a
word until she had finished, and then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam, there has been a good deal of talk
about knowing ourselves and showing ourselves
to others. Now I know myself very well indeed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
and I will show myself to you by saying that
when my heart is interested I obey no orders, I
pay no attention to mandates of any sort. Until
I can say what I have to say I will watch and I
will wait, but I shall not draw back.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time in fifteen years Mrs. Archibald
lost her temper. She turned pale with anger.
&#8220;You contemptible scoundrel! Go! Leave
this camp instantly!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood with arms folded and smiled at her,
saying nothing. She trembled, she was so angry.
But what could she do? If she called Mr. Archibald,
or if he should be awakened by any outcry,
she feared there would be bloodshed, and if she
went to call Matlack, Mr. Archibald would be
sure to be awakened. But at this moment some
one stepped up quickly behind Raybold, and with
a hand upon his shoulder, partly turned him
around.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;that I heard this
lady tell you to go. If so, go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did say it,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, hurriedly.
&#8220;Please be as quiet as you can, but make him
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear what Mrs. Archibald says?&#8221;
asked the bishop, sternly. &#8220;Depart, or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to threaten me?&#8221; asked Raybold.</p>
<p>The bishop stepped close to him. &#8220;Will you
go of your own accord,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;or do you
wish me to take you away?&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke quietly, but with an earnestness that
impressed itself upon Raybold, who made a quick
step backward. He felt a natural repugnance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
especially in the presence of a lady, to be taken
away by this big man, who, in the moonlight,
seemed to be bigger than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will speak to you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when there are
no ladies present.&#8221; And with this he retired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so much obliged to you,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald.
&#8220;It was a wonderful piece of good fortune
that you should have come at this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop smiled. &#8220;I am delighted that I
happened here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I heard so much talking
this evening that I thought I would tranquillize
my mind by a quiet walk by myself before I
went to bed, and so I happened to see you and
Raybold. Of course I had no idea of intruding
upon you, but when I saw you stretch out your
arm and say &#8216;Go!&#8217; I thought it was time for me
to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel bound to say to you,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald,
&#8220;that that impertinent fellow is persisting
in his attentions to Miss Dearborn, and that Mr.
Archibald and I will not have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagined that the discussion was on that
subject,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;for Mr. Clyde has intimated
to me that Raybold has been making
himself disagreeable to the young lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know what we are going to do,&#8221; said
Mrs. Archibald, reflectively; &#8220;there seems to be
no way of making an impression upon him. He
is like his sister&mdash;he will have his own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the bishop, with a sigh, &#8220;he is like
his sister. But then, one might thrash him, but
what can be done with her? I tell you, Mrs.
Archibald,&#8221; he said, turning to her, earnestly, &#8220;it
is getting to be unbearable. The whole evening,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
ever since you left the camp-fire, she has been
talking to me on the subject of mental assimilation&mdash;that
is, the treatment of our ideas and
thoughts as if they were articles of food&mdash;intellectual
soda biscuit, or plum pudding, for instance&mdash;in
order to find out whether our minds
can digest these things and produce from them
the mental chyme and chyle necessary to our intellectual
development. The discourse was fortunately
broken off for to-night, but there is more
of it for to-morrow. I really cannot stand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t stand it,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you simply go away and leave her when
she begins in that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop shook his head. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;that is impossible. When those beautiful eyes
are fixed upon me I cannot go away. They
charm me and they hold me. Unless there is an
interruption, I must stay and listen. The only
safety for me is to fly from this camp. At last,&#8221;
he said, smiling a little sadly, &#8220;I am going to go.
I did not want to do this until your camp broke
up, but I must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are really going to-morrow?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have positively decided
upon that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mrs. Archibald entered her cabin she
found her husband sleeping soundly, and she
again sat down by the window. There was no
such thing as sleep for her; her mind was more
tossed and troubled than it had been before she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
went out. The fact that the bishop was going
away made the matter worse, for just as she had
found out that he was willing to help her, and
that he might be able to keep Raybold away
from them without actual violence&mdash;for she saw
that the young boaster was afraid of him&mdash;he
had told her he must leave, and in her heart she
did not blame him. With great fear and anxiety
she looked forward to the morrow.</p>
<p>It was about two o&#8217;clock when Mrs. Archibald
suddenly arose from her seat by the window and
lighted a candle. Then she pulled down the
shades of the windows, front and back, after
which she went to her husband&#8217;s cot and put
her hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hector,&#8221; said she, &#8220;wake up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment Mr. Archibald was staring at her.
&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Are you
sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but I have something very
important to say to you. I want you to get up
and go away with me, and take Margery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald sat up in bed. He was now in
full possession of his senses. &#8220;What!&#8221; said he,
&#8220;elope? And where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that is exactly what I mean,
and we will go to Sadler&#8217;s first, and then home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean now?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that is, as soon as it is light,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you positively sure you are awake, Harriet?&#8221;
asked Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awake!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have not been asleep
to-night. Don&#8217;t you see I am dressed?&#8221; And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
she drew a chair to the bedside and sat down.
&#8220;I know more about what is going on than you
do, Hector,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I tell you if we stay
any longer in this camp, there is going to be
great trouble. That young Raybold pays no attention
to what you said about keeping away
from us. He comes here, when he pleases, and he
says he intends to come. I asked you to take a
walk with me this evening because I saw him
coming to the camp-fire and I knew that you
would resent it. To-night I saw him walking up
and down in front of our cabin, and I believe he
intended to try to speak to Margery. I went out
to him myself, and he was positively insulting. If
the bishop had not happened to come up, I believe
he would have stayed here and defied me.
But he made him go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you know this, Hector, it is very
certain that there will be trouble between you
and that young man, and I do not want that.
And, besides that, there is his sister; she is as
determined to preach as he is to speak to Margery.
The bishop says he can&#8217;t stand her any
longer, and he is going away to-morrow, and
that will make it all the worse for us&mdash;especially
for you, Hector. I cannot endure this state of
things; it has made me so nervous I cannot get
to sleep, and, besides, it is not right for us to
keep Margery where she must be continually
guarded from such a man. Now it may seem
foolish to run away, but I have thought over the
matter for hours and hours, and it is the only
thing to do; and what is more, it is very easy to
do. If we announce that we are going, we will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
all go, and the chief cause of quarrels and danger
will go with us. I know you, Hector; you will
not stand his impertinence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be daylight between three and four
o&#8217;clock, and we three can start out quietly and
have a pleasant walk to Sadler&#8217;s. It is only four
miles, and we can take our time. We need not
carry anything with us but what we choose to
put in our pockets. We can pack our bags and
leave them here, and Mr. Sadler will send for
them. When we get there we can go to bed if
we like, and have time enough for a good sleep
before breakfast, and then we can take the morning
stage and leave this place and everybody in
it. Now please don&#8217;t be hasty and tell me all
this is foolish. Remember, if you stay here you
have a quarrel on your hands, and I shall have
hours of misery until that quarrel is settled; and
no matter how it is settled, things will be disagreeable
afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harriet,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, suddenly twisting
himself so that he sat on the side of the bed,
&#8220;your idea is a most admirable one. It suits me
exactly. Let us run away. It is impossible for
us to do anything better than that. Have you
told Margery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but I will go to her
at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quick and quiet, then,&#8221; said her husband,
who had now entered fully into the spirit of the
adventure; &#8220;nobody must hear us. I will dress,
and then we will pack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, after three
times shaking the sleeping girl, &#8220;you must get up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Your uncle and I are going away, and you must
go with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery turned her great eyes on Mrs. Archibald,
but asked no questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;we cannot stay
in this camp any longer, on account of Mr. Raybold
and various other things. Matters have
come to a crisis, and we must go, and more than
that, we must slip away so that the others may
not go with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; asked Margery, now speaking for the
first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as it is daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So soon as that?&#8221; said the girl, a shadow on
her brow which was very plain in the light of the
candle which Mrs. Archibald had brought with
her. &#8220;Surely not before breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, a little sharply,
&#8220;you do not seem to understand&mdash;you are not
awake; we must start as soon as it is light. But
we cannot discuss it now. We are going, and
you must go with us. You must get up and pack
your things in your bag, which we shall send
for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly a light came into Margery&#8217;s eyes and
she sat up. &#8220;All right,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I will be
ready as soon as you are. It will be jolly to run
away, especially so early in the morning,&#8221; and with
that she jumped out of bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>AN ELOPEMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>A little more than an hour after Mrs. Archibald
had made known her project to her husband
the three inhabitants of the cabin stole softly
out into the delicate light of the early dawn.</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald had thought of leaving a note
for Matlack, but his wife had dissuaded him. She
was afraid that the wrong person might get hold
of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we are safely at Sadler&#8217;s,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we
can send for our bags, with a note to Matlack. It
will not matter then who knows.&#8221; She had a firm
belief in the power of the burly keeper of the inn
to prevent trouble on his premises.</p>
<p>With careful but rapid steps the little party
passed along the open portion of the camp, keeping
as far as possible from the tent wherein reposed
Corona and Mrs. Perkenpine, and soon
reached the entrance of the wood road. Here it
was not quite so light as in the open, but still
they could make their way without much trouble,
and after a few minutes&#8217; walking they felt perfectly
safe from observation, and slackening their
pace, they sauntered along at their ease.</p>
<p>The experience was a novel one to all of them;
even Mr. Archibald had never been in the woods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
so early in the morning. In fact, under these
great trees it could scarcely be said to be morning.
The young light which made its uncertain
way through the foliage was barely strong enough
to cast a shadow, and although these woodland
wanderers knew that it was a roadway in which
they were walking, that great trees stood on
each side of them, with branches reaching out
over their heads, and that there were bushes and
vines and here and there a moss-covered rock or
a fallen tree, they saw these things not clearly
and distinctly, but as through a veil. But there
was nothing uncertain about the air they breathed;
full of the moist aroma of the woods, it was
altogether different from the noonday odors of
the forest.</p>
<p>Stronger and stronger grew the morning light,
and more and more clearly perceptible became
the greens, the browns, and the grays about them.
Now the birds began to chatter and chirp, and
squirrels ran along the branches of the trees, while
a young rabbit bounced out from some bushes and
went bounding along the road. This early morning
life was something they had not seen in their
camp, for it was all over before they began their
day. There was a spring by the roadside, which
they had noticed when they had come that way
before, and when they reached it they sat down
and ate some biscuit which Mrs. Archibald had
brought with her, and drank cool water from Mr.
Archibald&#8217;s folding pocket-cup.</p>
<p>The loveliness of the scene, the novelty of the
experience, the feeling that they were getting
away from unpleasant circumstances, and in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
perfectly original and independent fashion, gave
them all high spirits. Even Mrs. Archibald, whose
sleepless night might have been supposed to interfere
with this morning walk, declared herself
as fresh as a lark, and stated that she knew now
why a lark or any other thing that got up early
in the morning should be fresh.</p>
<p>They had not left the spring far behind them
when they heard a rustling in the woods to the
right of the road, and the next moment there
sprang out into the open, not fifty feet in front of
them, a full-grown red deer. They were so startled
by this apparition that they all stopped as if
the beautiful creature had been a lion in their
path. For an instant it turned its great brown
eyes upon them, and then with two bounds it
plunged into the underbrush on the other side of
the road. Mrs. Archibald and Margery had never
before seen a deer in the woods.</p>
<p>The young girl clapped her hands. &#8220;It all reminds
me of my first night at the opera!&#8221; she
cried.</p>
<p>Two or three times they rested, and they never
walked rapidly, so it was after five o&#8217;clock when
the little party emerged into the open country
and approached the inn. Not a soul was visible
about the premises, but as they knew that some
one soon would be stirring, they seated themselves
in three arm-chairs on the wide piazza to
rest and wait.</p>
<p>Peter Sadler was an early riser, and when the
front hall door was open he appeared thereat, rolling
his wheeled chair out upon the piazza with a
bump&mdash;though not with very much of a bump,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
for the house was built to suit him and his chair.
But he did not take his usual morning roll upon
the piazza, for, turning his head, he beheld a gentleman
and two ladies fast asleep in three great
wicker chairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my soul!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;If they ain&#8217;t
the Camp Robbers!&#8221; At this exclamation they
all awoke.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after that the tale had been told,
and if the right arm of Mr. Sadler&#8217;s chair had not
been strong and heavy it would have been shivered
into splinters.</p>
<p>&#8220;As usual,&#8221; cried the stalwart Peter, &#8220;the
wrong people ran away. If I had seen that bicycle
man and his party come running out of the
woods, I should have been much better satisfied,
and I should have thought you had more spirit in
you, sir, than I gave you credit for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mistake my husband altogether!&#8221;
cried Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;The trouble with him is
that he has too much spirit, and that is the reason
I brought him away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is another thing,&#8221; exclaimed Margery.
&#8220;You should not say Mr. Raybold and his
party. He was the only one of them who behaved
badly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;His sister
is somewhat obtrusive, but she is a lady, gentle
and polite, and it would have been very painful
to her and as painful to us had it been necessary
forcibly to eject her brother from our camp. It
was to avoid all this that we&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eloped,&#8221; interjected Mr. Archibald.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;&#8216;IF THEY AIN&#8217;T THE CAMP ROBBERS!&#8217;&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>The good Peter laughed. &#8220;Perhaps you are
right,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I shall have a word with
that bicycle fellow when he comes this way. You
are an original party, if there ever was one. First
you go on somebody else&#8217;s wedding-journey, and
then you elope in the middle of the night, and
now the best thing you can do is to go to bed.
You can have a good sleep and a nine-o&#8217;clock
breakfast, and I do not see why you should leave
here for two or three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we must go this morning,&#8221; said Mrs.
Archibald, quickly. &#8220;We must go. We really
cannot wait until any of those people come here.
It makes me nervous to think about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, then,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;The coach
starts for the train at eleven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Archibald was a systematic woman, and
was in the habit of rising at half-past seven, and
when that hour arrived she awoke as if she had
been asleep all night. Going to the window to
see what sort of a day it was, which was also her
custom, she looked out upon the lawn in front of
the house, and her jaw dropped and her eyes
opened. There she beheld Margery and Mr.
Clyde strolling along in close converse. For a
moment she was utterly stupefied.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can this mean?&#8221; she thought. &#8220;How
could they have missed us so soon? We are seldom
out of our cabin before eight o&#8217;clock. I cannot
comprehend it!&#8221; And then a thought came
to her which made her face grow pale. &#8220;Is it possible,&#8221;
she said to herself, &#8220;that any of the others
have come? I must go immediately and find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>In ten minutes she had dressed and quietly left
the room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>When Margery saw Mrs. Archibald descending
the piazza, steps, she left Mr. Clyde and came
running to meet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you are surprised to see me here,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;but I intended to tell you and Uncle
Archibald as soon as you came down. You see, I
did not at all want to go away and not let Mr.
Clyde know what had become of me, and so, after
I had packed my bag, I wrote a little note to him
and put it in a biscuit-box under a stone not far
from my window, which we had arranged for a
post-office, just the day before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A post-office!&#8221; cried Mrs. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;Of course there wasn&#8217;t
any need for one&mdash;at least we did not suppose
there would be&mdash;but we thought it would be nice;
for, you must know, we are engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;Engaged?
Impossible! What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;we are really engaged,
and it was absolutely necessary. Under ordinary
circumstances this would not have happened so
soon, but as things were it could not be delayed.
Mr. Clyde thought the matter over very carefully,
and he decided that the only way to keep me
from being annoyed and frightened by Mr. Raybold
was for him to have the right to defend me.
If he told Mr. Raybold I was engaged to him, that
of course would put an end to the young man&#8217;s
attentions. We were engaged only yesterday, so
we haven&#8217;t had any time to tell anybody, but we
intended to do it to-day, beginning with you and
Uncle Archibald. Harrison came over early to
the post-office, hoping to find some sort of a note,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
and he was wonderfully astonished when he read
what was in the one I put there. I told him not
to say anything to anybody, and he didn&#8217;t, but
he started off for Sadler&#8217;s immediately, and came
almost on a run, he says, he was so afraid I might
go away before he saw me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margery,&#8221; exclaimed the elder lady, tears
coming into her eyes as she spoke, &#8220;I am grieved
and shocked beyond expression. What can I say
to my husband? What can I say to your mother?
From the bottom of my heart I wish we had not
brought you with us; but how could I dream
that all this trouble would come of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is indeed a very great pity,&#8221; said Margery,
&#8220;that Mr. Clyde and I could not have been engaged
before we went into camp; then Mr. Raybold
would have had no reason to bother me, and
I should have had no trouble with Martin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin!&#8221; cried Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;What of
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he was in love with me too,&#8221; replied the
young girl, &#8220;and we had talks about it, and I sent
him away. He was really a young man far above
his station, and was doing the things he did simply
because he wanted to study nature; but of
course I could not consider him at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that was the reason he left us!&#8221; exclaimed
Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;Upon my word, it is
amazing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Margery; &#8220;and don&#8217;t you see,
Aunt Harriet, how many reasons there were why
Mr. Clyde and I should settle things definitely and
become engaged? Now there need be no further
trouble with anybody.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>Distressed as she was, Mrs. Archibald could
not refrain from smiling. &#8220;No further trouble!&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I think you would better wait until
Mr. Archibald and your mother have heard this
story before you say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald was dressing for breakfast when
his wife told him of Margery&#8217;s engagement, and
the announcement caused him to twirl around so
suddenly that he came very near breaking a looking-glass
with his hair-brush. He made a dash
for his coat. &#8220;I will see him,&#8221; he said, and his
eyes sparkled in a way which indicated that they
could discover a malefactor without the aid of
spectacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; said his wife, standing in his way.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go to them when you are angry. We
have just got out of trouble, and don&#8217;t let us
jump into it again. If they are really and truly
engaged&mdash;and I am sure they are&mdash;we have no
authority to break it off, and the less you say the
better. What we must do is to take her immediately
to her mother, and let her settle the matter
as best she can. If she knows her daughter as
well as I do, I am sure she will acquit us of all
blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald was very indignant and said a
great deal, but his wife was firm in her counsel
to avoid any hard words or bad feeling in a matter
over which they had now no control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, at last, &#8220;I will pass over the
whole affair to Mrs. Dearborn, but I hope I may
eat my breakfast without seeing them. Whatever
happens, I need a good meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mr. Archibald came out of the breakfast-room,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
his mind considerably composed by hot
rolls and coffee, he met Margery in the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Uncle Archibald,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I have
been waiting and waiting for you. I hope you
are not angry. Please be as kind to us as you can,
and remember, it was just the same with us as it
was with you and Aunt Harriet. You would not
have run away from the camp in the middle of
the night if you could have helped it, and we
should not have been engaged so suddenly if we
could have helped it. But we all had to do what
we did on account of the conduct of others, and
as it is settled now, I think we ought all to try to
be as happy as we can, and forget our troubles.
Here is Harrison, and he and I both pray from
the bottom of our hearts that you will shake
hands with him. I know you always liked him,
for you have said so. And now we are both
going to mother to tell her all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both?&#8221; said Mr. Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Margery; &#8220;we must go together,
otherwise mother would know nothing about him,
and I should be talking to no purpose. But we
are going to do everything frankly and openly
and go straight to her, and put our happiness in
her hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald looked at her steadfastly. &#8220;Such
ingenuousness,&#8221; he said, presently, &#8220;is overpowering.
Mr. Clyde, how do you do? Do you think
it is going to be a fine day?&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man smiled. &#8220;I think it is going to
be a fine lifetime,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>The party was gathered together on the piazza,
ready to take the coach. The baggage had arrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
from the camp in a cart; but Phil Matlack
had not come with it, as he remained to take
down his tent and settle affairs generally. They
were all sorry not to see him again, for he had
proved himself a good man and a good guide; but
when grown-up married people elope before daybreak
something must be expected to go wrong.
Hearty and substantial remembrances were left
for him, and kind words of farewell for the
bishop, and even for Miss Corona when she
should appear.</p>
<p>Peter Sadler was loath to part with his guests.
&#8220;You are more interesting now than ever you
were,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I want to hear all about
that hermit business; you&#8217;ve just barely mentioned
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, with a
solemn visage, &#8220;sooner or later Miss Corona
Raybold will present herself at this inn on her
way home. If you want to know anything about
her plan to assist human beings to assert their
individualities, it will only be necessary to mention
the fact to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, then,&#8221; said Peter, shaking hands
with Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
what out-of-the-way thing you two will do next,
but, whatever it is, I hope it will bring you here.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>MRS. PERKENPINE DELIGHTS THE BISHOP</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the bishop who first appreciated the fact
that a certain air of loneliness had descended
upon the shore of the lake. He had prepared
breakfast at his camp, but as Mr. Clyde did not
make his appearance he went to Camp Rob to
look for him. There he saw Matlack and his assistant
busy in their kitchen tent, and Mrs. Perkenpine
was also engaged in culinary matters.
He had left Arthur Raybold asleep at Camp Roy,
but of the ladies and gentleman who were usually
visible at the breakfast-hour at Camp Rob he
saw no signs, and he approached Mrs. Perkenpine
to inquire for Clyde. At his question the sturdy
woman turned and smiled. It was a queer smile,
reminding the bishop of the opening and shutting
of a farm gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a one-er,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Do you suppose
he could ketch a rabbit, no matter how fast he
ran?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, now,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;he wasn&#8217;t trying
to do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was either doin&#8217; that, or else he was runnin&#8217;
away. I seed him early this mornin&#8217;&mdash;I
wasn&#8217;t up, but I was lookin&#8217; round&mdash;and I thought
from the way he was actin&#8217; that he&#8217;d set a rabbit-trap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
and was goin&#8217; to see if he&#8217;d caught anything,
and pretty soon I seed him runnin&#8217; like Sam Hill,
as if his rabbit had got away from him. But
perhaps it wasn&#8217;t that, and maybe somebody
skeered him. Anyway, he&#8217;s clean gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop stood and reflected; the affair
looked serious. Clyde was a practical, sensible
fellow&mdash;and he was gone. Why did he go?</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen any of the Archibalds yet?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said she; &#8220;I guess they&#8217;re not up yet,
though it&#8217;s late for them. My young woman
ain&#8217;t up nuther, but it ain&#8217;t late for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop walked slowly towards the cabin and
regarded it earnestly. After a few minutes inspection
he stepped up to the door and knocked.
Then he knocked again and again, and hearing
nothing from within he became alarmed, and ran
to Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Something has happened
to your people, or they have gone away. Come
to the cabin, quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>In less than a minute Matlack, the bishop, and
Bill Hammond were at the cabin, and the unfastened
door was opened wide. No one was in
the house, that was plain enough, but on the
floor were four bags packed for transportation.</p>
<p>Matlack looked about him, and then he laughed.
&#8220;All right,&#8221; said he; &#8220;there ain&#8217;t no need of worryin&#8217;
ourselves. They haven&#8217;t left a thing of
theirs about, everything&#8217;s packed up and ready
to be sent for. When people do that, you may be
sure nothing&#8217;s happened to them. They&#8217;ve gone
off, and I bet it&#8217;s to get rid of that young woman&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
preachin&#8217;. But I don&#8217;t blame them; I don&#8217;t
wonder they couldn&#8217;t stand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop made no reply. Remembering his
recent conversation with Mrs. Archibald, he believed
that, if they had quietly gone away, there
was a better reason for it than Miss Raybold&#8217;s
fluency of expression. It was possible that something
might have happened after he had retired
from the scene the night before, for when he
went to sleep Raybold was still walking up and
down in the moonlight.</p>
<p>His mind was greatly disturbed. They were
gone, and he was left. &#8220;What are you going to
do?&#8221; he asked Matlack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; just now,&#8221; said the guide. &#8220;If they
don&#8217;t send for their things pretty soon, I&#8217;ll go
over to Sadler&#8217;s and find out what&#8217;s the matter.
But they&#8217;re all right. Look how careful them
bags is strapped up!&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop left the cabin and walked thoughtfully
away in the direction of Camp Roy. In two
minutes he had made up his mind: he would eat
his breakfast&mdash;he could not travel upon an empty
stomach&mdash;and then he would depart. That was
imperative.</p>
<p>When he reached the camp he found that Raybold
had risen and was pouring out for himself a
bowl of coffee. Seeing the bishop approach, the
young man&#8217;s face grew dark, as might have been
expected from the events of the night before, and
he hurriedly placed some articles of food upon
a plate, and was about leaving the stove when
the bishop reached him. Raybold turned with a
frown, and what was meant to be a glare.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall bide my time,&#8221; said he, and with his
coffee and his plate he retired to a distance.</p>
<p>The bishop smiled but made no answer, and sat
down and ate his meal in peace; then he prepared
to depart. He had nothing but a little
bag, and it did not take long to put in order the
simple culinary department of the camp. When
all was done he stood for some minutes thinking.
There was a path through the woods which led
to the road, so that he might go on to Sadler&#8217;s
without the knowledge of any one at Camp Rob,
but he felt that he ought to see Matlack and tell
him that he was going. If anything went wrong
at Camp Roy he did not wish to be held responsible
for it. Mr. Archibald could afford to go
away without saying anything about it, but he
could not, and, besides, if he should happen to see
Miss Raybold it would be far more gentlemanly
to tell her that he was going and to bid her goodbye,
than to slip off through the woods like a
tramp. He would go, that he was determined
upon; but he would go like a man.</p>
<p>When he reached Camp Rob the first person
he saw was Miss Raybold, standing near her tent
with a roll of paper in her hand. The moment
she perceived him she walked rapidly towards
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Did you know that
the Archibalds had gone? I never was so amazed
in all my life. I was eating my breakfast when a
man and a cart drove up to their cabin, and Mrs.
Perkenpine, running to see what this meant, soon
came back and told me that the family of three
had departed in the night, and had sent this cart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
for their baggage. I think this was a very uncivil
proceeding, and I do not in the least understand
it. Can you imagine any reason for this
extremely uncourteous action?&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop could imagine reasons, but he did
not care to state them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; he said, with a smile, &#8220;that they
discovered that their natures demanded hotel
beds instead of camp cots, and that they immediately
departed in obedience to the mandates of
their individualities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But in so doing,&#8221; said Miss Raybold, &#8220;they
violated the principles of association. Our scheme
included mutual confidence as well as self-investigation
and assertion. I must admit that Mr.
Archibald disappointed me. I think he misunderstood
my project. By holding one&#8217;s self entirely
aloof from humanity one encourages self-ignorance.
But perhaps our party was somewhat too
large&mdash;the elements too many and inharmonious&mdash;and
I see no reason why we who remain
should relinquish our purpose. I believe it will
be easier for us to become truly ourselves than
when our number was greater, and so I propose
that we make no change whatever in our plans;
that we live on, for the time agreed upon, exactly
as if the Archibalds were here. And now,
if you have a few minutes to spare, I would like
to read you something I wrote this morning before
I left my tent. I was awake during the
night, and thought for a long time upon the subject
of mental assimilation, the discussion of
which we did not finish last evening, and this
morning, while my thoughts were fresh, I put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
them upon paper, and now I would like to read
them to you. Isn&#8217;t there some shady place where
we might sit down? There are two camp-chairs;
will you kindly place them under this tree?&#8221;</p>
<p>The bishop sighed, but he went for the chairs.
It would be too hard for him to tell her he was
going to leave the camp, and he would not try
to do it. He would slip off as soon as he had a
chance, and leave a note for her. She would not
perhaps like that, but it was the best he could do.</p>
<p>The reading of the paper occupied at least half
an hour, and when it was finished, and Corona
had begun to make some remarks on a portion of
it which she had not fully elaborated, Mrs. Perkenpine
approached, and stood before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, miss,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Raybold fixed her eye-glasses upon her.
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back to Sadler&#8217;s,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Phil&#8217;s
goin&#8217;, and I&#8217;m goin&#8217;. He&#8217;s jest told me that the
cart&#8217;s comin&#8217; back for the kitchen fixin&#8217;s and his
things, and him and Bill Hammond is goin&#8217; to
Sadler&#8217;s with it; and if he goes, I goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>This speech had a very different effect upon its
two hearers. Corona was as nearly angry as her
self-contained nature would permit; but, although
he did not allow his feelings to betray
him, the bishop was delighted. Now they must
all go, and that suited him exactly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a positive and absolute breach of contract!&#8221;
exclaimed Miss Raybold. &#8220;You agreed
to remain in my service during my stay in camp,
and you have no right to go away now, no matter
who else may depart.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Perkenpine grinned. &#8220;That sort of thing
was all very well a week ago,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but it
won&#8217;t work now. I&#8217;ve been goin&#8217; to school to
myself pretty steady, and I&#8217;ve kept myself in a
good deal, too, for not knowin&#8217; my lessons, and
I&#8217;ve drummed into me a pretty good idea of what
I be, and I can tell you I&#8217;m not a woman as stays
here when Phil Matlack&#8217;s gone. I&#8217;m not a bit
scary, but I never stayed in camp yet with all
greenhorns but me. When I find myself in that
sort of a mess, it&#8217;s my nater to get out of it. Phil
says he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to start the fust thing this afternoon,
and that&#8217;s the time I&#8217;m goin&#8217;, and so, if you
would like to go, you can send word by that man
in the cart to have you and your things sent for,
and we can all clear out together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Positively,&#8221; exclaimed Corona, turning to the
bishop, &#8220;this is the most high-handed proceeding
I ever heard of!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s &#8217;xactly what I think,&#8221; said Mrs. Perkenpine;
&#8220;it most takes my breath away to think
how high-handed I am. Before I knowed myself
I couldn&#8217;t have been that way to save my skin.
There didn&#8217;t use to be any individdlety about
me. You might take a quart of huckleberries
and ask yourself what it was particular &#8217;bout any
one of them huckleberries&mdash;&#8217;xceptin&#8217; it might be
green, and it&#8217;s a long time since I was that way&mdash;and
you&#8217;d know jest as much about that huckleberry
as I knowed about myself. Now it&#8217;s different.
It&#8217;s just the same as if there was only one
huckleberry in a quart box, and it ain&#8217;t no trouble
to see all around that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Miss Raybold,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
this good woman has prosecuted her psychical
researches with more effect than any of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Raybold. &#8220;Do you
really think I must leave this camp at the dictation
of that person?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse me,&#8221; said Mrs. Perkenpine, &#8220;but I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to scratch things together for movin&#8217;. We&#8217;ll
have dinner here, and then we&#8217;ll pack up and be
off as soon as the carts come. That&#8217;s what Phil
says he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a satisfied mind and internal gratitude to
Mrs. Perkenpine, who had made everything easy
for him, the bishop endeavored to make Corona
feel that, as her departure from the camp was inevitable,
it would be well not to disturb her mind
too much about it. But it was of no use trying
to console the lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it is humiliating.
Here I believed that I was truly myself; that I
was an independent entity; that I was free to
assert my individual nature and to obey its impulses,
and now I find that I am nothing but the
slave of a female guide. Actually I must obey
her, and I must conform to her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; said the bishop, musingly, &#8220;that
although we may discover ourselves, and be
greatly pleased with the prospect of what we see,
we may not be permitted to enter into its enjoyment,
and must content ourselves with looking
over the fence and longing for what we see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corona faintly smiled. &#8220;When we have climbed
high enough to see over that fence,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it
becomes our duty to break it down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was in England,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
saw a fence&mdash;an oak fence&mdash;which they told me
had stood for four hundred years. It looked
awfully tough, and it now reminds me of some of
the manners and customs of civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you were in England,&#8221; said Corona,
&#8220;did you visit Newnham College?&#8221;</p>
<p>He never had. But she told him that she had
been there for two years. &#8220;And now,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;there may be time enough before I must
pack up my effects to finish what I was going to
say to you about approximate assimilations.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE HERMITS CONTINUE TO FAVOR ASSOCIATION</h3>
</div>

<p>When the Archibald party reached the capital
city of their State, the four of them took a carriage
and drove immediately to the Dearborn
residence. Margery had insisted that Mr. Clyde
should go with them, so that he and she should
present themselves together before her parents.
In no other way did she believe that the subject
could be properly presented. The Archibalds did
not object to this plan; in fact, under the circumstances,
they were in favor of it. During the
journey young Clyde had produced a very favorable
impression upon them. They had always
liked him well enough, and now that they examined
his character more critically, they could not
fail to see that he was a kind-hearted, gentlemanly
young man, intelligent and well educated,
and, according to private information from Margery,
his family was of the best.</p>
<p>Arrived at the Dearborn door, they found the
house in the possession of one female servant, who
informed them that Mr. Dearborn was in Canada,
on a fishing expedition; that Mrs. Dearborn had
gone to attend some sort of a congress at Saratoga,
and that she did not expect to be at home
until the following Friday, three days after, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
was the day on which she had expected her
daughter to be brought back to her. This was
disheartening, and the four stood upon the steps
irresolute. Margery ought to go to her mother,
but neither of the Archibalds wished to go to
Saratoga, nor could they despatch thither the
prematurely betrothed couple.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what we must do,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald,
&#8220;we must go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear,&#8221; said her husband, &#8220;we agreed
to stay away for a month, and the month is not
yet up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Kate and her
husband will take us in for the few days left.
When we explain all that we have gone through,
she will not be hard-hearted enough to make us go
to a hotel until Friday; Margery can come with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margery turned upon Mrs. Archibald a pair of
eyes filled with earnest inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you want,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald.
&#8220;No, he can go to a hotel in the town; and I shall
write to your mother to come to us as soon as she
returns; then you two can present yourselves together
according to your plans. There is no use
talking about it, Hector; it is the only thing we
can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall break our word to the newly married,&#8221;
said her husband. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a State law
against that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we made that arrangement,&#8221; said his
wife, going down the steps, &#8220;we did not know
our individual selves; now we do, and the case is
different. Kate will understand all that when I
explain it to her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>They drove back to the station, and took a train
for home.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bringhurst were sitting in the cool
library about nine o&#8217;clock that evening; he was
reading while she was listening, and they were
greatly astonished when they heard a carriage
drive up to the front door. During their domestic
honey-moon they had received no visitors, and
they looked at each other and wondered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a mistake,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but don&#8217;t trouble
yourself. Mary has not gone to bed, and she will
hear the bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no bell; the door was opened,
and in came father and mother, followed by a
strange young couple.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed Kate, when at
last everybody had been embraced or introduced.
&#8220;A dozen times during the last week have we
talked about the delight it would give us if our
father and mother could be here to be entertained
a little while as our guests in our own
house&mdash;for you gave it to us for a month, you
know. But we refrained from sending you an invitation
because we did not want to cut off your
holiday. And now you are here! The good fairies
could not have arranged the matter better.&#8221;</p>
<p>When all the tales had been told; when the assertion
of individuality and the plans of hermit
association had been described and discussed, and
the young Bringhursts had told how they, too,
without knowing it, had been associate hermits,
devoting their time not to the discovery of their
own natures, but of the nature of each other, and
how perfectly satisfied they had been with the results,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
it was very late, and young Clyde was not
allowed to go out into the darkness to find a
hotel.</p>
<p>It was on Thursday afternoon that Mrs. Dearborn
arrived at the Archibalds&#8217; house. The letter
she had received had made her feel that she could
not wait until the end of the congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, mother,&#8221; said Margery, when the two
were alone together, &#8220;you have seen him and you
have talked to him, and Uncle Hector has told
you how he went to the office of Glassborough &amp;
Clyde and found he was really their nephew, and
all about him and his family; and you have been
told precisely why it was necessary that we should
engage ourselves so abruptly on account of the
violent nature of Mr. Raybold and the trouble he
might cause, not only to us, but to dear Aunt
Harriet and Uncle Archibald. And now we come
just like two of your own children and put the
whole matter entirely into your hands and leave
you to decide, out of your own heart, exactly
when and where we shall be married, and all
about it. Then, when father comes home, you
can tell him just what you have decided to do.
You are our parents, and we leave it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world,&#8221; said Mrs. Dearborn, an
hour later, when she was talking to the two married
ladies of the household, &#8220;can one do with a
girl like that? I do not believe dynamite would
blow them apart; and if I thought it would I
should not know how to manage it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mrs. Archibald, &#8220;I am afraid the
explosion would be as bad for you as it would be
for them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try it,&#8221; said Mrs. Kate. &#8220;I take a great
interest in that budding bit of felicity; I consider
it an outgrowth of our own marriage and honey-moon.
When we sent out that wild couple, my
father and mother, on a wedding-tour, we did not
dream that they would bring back to us a pair of
lovers, who never would have been lovers if it had
not been for us, and who are now ready for a
wedding-tour on their own account, as soon as
circumstances may permit. And so, feeling a
little right and privilege in the matter, I am going
to ask you, Mrs. Dearborn, to let them be
married here whenever the wedding-day shall
come, and let them start out from this house on
their marriage career. Now don&#8217;t you think that
would be a fine plan? I am sure your daughter
will like it, when she remembers what she owes
us; and if Mr. Clyde objects I will undertake to
make him change his mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the plan was proposed in full counsel, it
was found that there would be no need for the
exercise of Mrs. Kate&#8217;s powers of persuasion.</p>

<p>About ten days after Mrs. Dearborn and Margery
had returned to their home, and Clyde had
followed, to move like a satellite in an orbit determined
by Mrs. Dearborn, Mr. Archibald was
surprised, but also very much pleased, to receive
a visit from the bishop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not refrain,&#8221; said that expansive individual,
&#8220;from coming to you as soon as circumstances
would allow, and, while expressing to you
the great obligations under which you have placed
me, to confide to you my plans and my prospects.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
You have been so good to me that I believe you
will be pleased to know of the life work to which
I have determined to devote myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;that you
have made plans, but you owe nothing to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;but I do. This
suit of clothes, sir, is the foundation of my fortunes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And well earned,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald. &#8220;But
we will say no more about that. Have you
secured a position? Tell me about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a position,&#8221; said the bishop. &#8220;But
would you prefer that I tell you of that first, or
begin at the beginning and briefly relate to you
what has happened since I saw you last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, begin at the beginning, by all means,&#8221;
said Mr. Archibald. &#8220;I was sorry to be obliged
to leave you all so unceremoniously, and I greatly
desire to know what happened after we left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, then,&#8221; said the bishop, &#8220;I will
give you our history in as few words as I can.
On the afternoon after your departure we all
went to Sadler&#8217;s&mdash;that is, Miss Raybold and myself
and the three guides; for Raybold, when he
heard that Miss Dearborn and Mr. Clyde had
gone, immediately left for Sadler&#8217;s, hoping, I
think, to find you all there. From what I heard,
I think he and Peter Sadler must have had
words. At any rate, he discovered that his case
was hopeless, and he had himself driven to the
station in a carriage, not choosing to wait until
our arrival. I have since heard that he has determined
to relinquish the law and devote himself
to the dramatic arts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For some reason or other, Peter Sadler was
very glad to see me, and congratulated me heartily
on the favorable change in my appearance.
He called me his favorite tramp, and invited me
to stop at his hotel for a time, but I consented to
stay a few days only, for I felt I must go to see
the gentleman to whom I wished to engage myself
as librarian before my new clothes had lost
their freshness. Miss Raybold arranged to stay
at Sadler&#8217;s for a week. She liked the place, and
as she had planned to remain away from home for
a fortnight, she did not wish to return before the
time fixed upon. There were a good many people
at Sadler&#8217;s, but none of them seemed to interest
her. She decidedly preferred to talk to
Sadler or to me; but although Peter is a jolly
fellow, and had some lively conversations with
her, he does not seem to care for protracted mental
intercourse, and it became so plain to me that
she depended upon me, in so large a degree, for
companionship and intellectual stimulus, that I
did not leave as soon as I intended. It was on
Wednesday, in fact, that I steeled my heart and
told her that I must positively depart early the
following morning, or I could not expect to reach
my destination before the end of the week. It
was that evening, however, that we became engaged
to be married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Mr. Archibald. &#8220;Did you dare
to propose yourself to that classic being?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the other, &#8220;I cannot, with exactness,
say that I did. It would be difficult, indeed,
for me to describe the manner in which we
arrived at this most satisfactory conclusion. Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
Raybold is a mistress of expression, and, without
moving a hair&#8217;s-breadth beyond the lines of maidenly
reserve which always environ her, she made
me aware, not only that I desired to propose marriage
to her, but that it would be well for me to
do so. There were objections to this course,
which, as an honest man, I could not refrain from
laying before her, and with my proposition I
stated these objections, but they were overruled
to my entire satisfaction, and she consented to
become Mrs. Bishop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Bishop?&#8221; said the other, inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes; Bishop is my name&mdash;Henry C. Bishop.
It was this name which suggested the title
which was playfully given to me. Before our
compact was made I had told Miss Raybold all
about my family. She did not ask me to do so,
but I knew she desired the information, for I had
learned to read those beautiful eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;how about your
position? Did you get the place as librarian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;I did not ask for it.
The question of my vocation has been settled
most admirably. There never was a human being
more frank, more straightforward and pertinent
than Miss Raybold. She knows what she
wants, and she makes her plans to get it. With
regard to means she is sufficiently endowed, but
the life work to which she has devoted herself is
far more than she can ever accomplish alone.
She needs the constant assistance of a sympathetic
and appreciative nature, and that, I am
happy to say, I am able to give to her; and were
I to devote myself to any other calling which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
would interfere with that assistance, I should be
doing her a positive wrong. Therefore, should I
state it in definite words, I should say that I am
to become my wife&#8217;s private secretary. That is
my position, and it suits me admirably; and I
may add that Corona assures me that she is thoroughly
well pleased. We are to be married in
the fall, and I hope it will not be long before we
shall have the pleasure of meeting again our former
companions of the hermit camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By-the-way,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, as his visitor
was about to leave, &#8220;tell me something of Matlack.
I had a great liking for our guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All that I can tell you is this,&#8221; said Mr. Bishop,
smiling: &#8220;Not long after we arrived at
Sadler&#8217;s, he went to Peter and asked him if he
intended to send out a camping party to any
considerable distance. It so happened that a
couple of gentlemen were going to a point on the
very limits of Sadler&#8217;s jurisdiction, and with them
Matlack petitioned to go, although another guide
had been appointed. I made inquiries, and found
that, for some reason, probably connected with
the persistencies of the female sex, Matlack had
become a sort of Daniel Boone and wanted to go
away as far as possible from his kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Mr. Archibald, &#8220;that our example
has not made a real hermit of him. Good-bye.
I am very sorry that Mrs. Archibald is not at
home; but in both our names I wish you and
your future wife the best of good fortunes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Kate, when she heard
of this interview, &#8220;now you must grant me one
more favor! Here is another pair of lovers who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
owe everything to our honey-moon and your wedding-tour.
We ought to know them, for we made
them what they are. So let us invite them here,
and let them be married from this house. I do
not believe Miss Raybold has a proper home of
her own; and, in any case, the only way they can
pay us what they owe us is to give us the pleasure
of seeing them wedded here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald rose to his feet. &#8220;No, madam!&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I am willing, to a certain extent, to
make this house a source of hymeneal felicity,
but I draw the line at the bishop. I do not intend
that my home shall become a matrimonial
factory!&#8221;</p>

it through and through, and yet never forgets that, while realistic, she is
first and last an artist.&mdash;<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>
<p>Miss Wilkins has attained an eminent position among her literary contemporaries

brief dramatic incident. Few surpass her in expressing the homely pathos
of the poor and ignorant, while the humor of her stories is quiet, pervasive,
and suggestive.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Press.</i></p>

to give an episode of New England its soul, pathos, and poetry.&mdash;<i>N.

<p>The pathos of New England life, its intensities of repressed feeling, its

<p>The simplicity, purity, and quaintness of these stories set them apart in
a niche of distinction where they have no rivals.&mdash;<i>Literary World</i>, Boston.</p>

and comprehension of humble life, and the sweet human interest she
feels and makes her readers partake of, in the simple, common, homely
people she draws.&mdash;<i>Springfield Republican.</i></p>
